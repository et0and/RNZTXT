            <p>Reactions from around the world began flooding in tonight as Fox News projected that Republican Donald Trump had defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, which would cap a stunning political comeback four years after he left the White House.</p>
        
            <p>"Congratulations on history's greatest comeback! Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory! In true friendship," Netanyahu wrote on X.</p>

            <p>"Yesssss, God bless Trump," Ben-Gvir said on X.</p>
        
            <p>"Trump has one useful quality for us: as a businessman to the core, he mortally dislikes spending money on various hangers-on and stupid hanger-on allies, on bad charity projects and on voracious international organisations," Medvedev, now a senior security official, posted on his official Telegram account.</p>
        
            <p>"Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump on the election victory. The United States is an important strategic partner for Austria. We look forward to further expanding and strengthening our transatlantic relations to successfully address global challenges together."</p>
        
            <p>"In the United States a victory for common sense, passion and the future. Good luck with your work, President Donald Trump," Salvini posted, adding the hashtag "GODonaldGO".</p>
