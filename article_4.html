        <h2>Wellington's Reading Cinemas deal debate to go public</h2>
        <p>
Council staff have recommended Thursday's meeting stays private, but Mayor Tory Whanau is keen for it to be public.

            <p>A closed-door meeting has been held with Wellington City councillors and the council's chief executive on the $32 million Reading Cinemas deal.</p>
        
            <p>The council has proposed to buy the land under the earthquake-prone shopping complex on Courtenay Place and lease it back to the cinemas company that currently owns it.</p>
        
            <p>The deal was first presented to councillors in October and was meant to remain private due to commercial sensitivities, but it was leaked.</p>
        
            <p>Following this, Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau launched an independent probe into city councillors Nicola Young, Iona Pannett, Ray Chung, Tony Randle and Dianne Calvert.</p>
        
            <p>A notice of motion by councillor Iona Pannett has been filed to have a public debate on the proposal on Thursday.</p>

            <p>RNZ has seen email correspondence from Wellington City Council chief executive Barbara McKerrow that said they planned a discussion with elected members on Wednesday to be prepared for a public discussion on the proposal.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors called for the meeting to discuss the technical details in advance of the debate on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Council staff have recommended that Thursday's meeting does stay private, but Whanau was keen for it to be public so everyone understood the plan.</p>
        
            <p>"Officers' advice continues to be that this remains private, but when it comes to the upcoming motion from Cr Pannett to have the debate in public, I will be supporting that so that the public can understand the deal in full."</p>
        
            <p>Whanau said it had been really frustrating to see details leaked about the plan.</p>
        
            <p>"A lot of what has been said about this proposal with Reading is inaccurate and misleading, such as the assertion the deal will have an impact on rates. It is a fiscally neutral proposal."</p>
