            <p>Police say a child has died after what they have called a driveway 'incident' in Northland.</p>
        
            <p>The incident occurred on Pupuke-Mangapa Road in the Whangaroa area, west of Kāeo, about 4.20pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokeswoman said the child was taken to a nearby medical centre but could not be saved.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were speaking to the child's family as part of their investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The fatality comes less than two weeks after a three-year-old boy died in similar circumstances in the Whangārei suburb of Te Kamo.</p>
        
            <p>In that case, the child died at the scene on Church Road on the afternoon of 23 February.</p>
        
            <p>St John Ambulance referred enquiries about the Kāeo fatality to police.</p>
        
            <p>More to come.</p>
