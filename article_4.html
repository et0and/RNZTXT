            <p>A new social housing development in the Gisborne suburb of Tamarau will house 31 families, many of whom are moving from motels or social housing.</p>
        
            <p>According to Kāinga Ora, 27 whānau, including 24 tamariki, will be moving out of temporary accommodation into these new homes, which were completed last week.</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora manages more than 70,000 properties nationwide, accommodating nearly 185,000 people, with more than 160 homes built in Gisborne in the last three years.</p>
        
            <p>It said another 162 state homes were in progress, and early plans underway for about 120 more.</p>
        
            <p>East North Island regional director Naomi Whitewood said it was Gisborne's largest social housing development in decades, and it had been a boost for the local economy.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that having a stable home is important to all aspects of a person's life - from education and employment to physical and mental health," Whitewood said.</p>
        
            <p>The homes, a mix of one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-bedroom single-storey duplexes and standalones, had been budgeted for in the government's Public Housing Plan, and built by private developer TW Property.</p>
        
            <p>Moving in were a mix of younger families, older people and others with accessibility challenges, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Twenty-seven of the 31 homes have been built to full universal design standards. Some come with ramps, wider doors and accessible bathrooms."</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Social Development's regional commissioner Karen Bartlett said the ministry was pleased to work alongside Kāinga Ora to see new families moving move in.</p>
        
            <p>"We know temporary and emergency accommodation is not an ideal way to raise a family and moving 24 tamariki into a secure and stable home is a reason to celebrate."</p>
        
            <p>TW Group spokesperson Leah MacDonell said more than 70 job opportunities had been created for Gisborne tradespeople.</p>
        
            <p>"We have signed up several apprentices who have been working on this development, equipping them with invaluable skills while bolstering the local workforce."</p>
        
            <p>To ensure that there was no extra pressure on Gisborne's stormwater network that would contribute to future flooding, 31 2000-litre attenuation tanks were installed on-site, which would capture stormwater runoff and slowly release it back into the city's stormwater system.</p>
        
            <p>The homes in Tamarau would be blessed with the help of local iwi on Monday, with the new tenants moving in straight away.</p>
