            <p>Gang leader Jamie Pink has agreed to hand over $300,000 of his ill-gotten gains to the Crown - less than one-fifth of the amount police believe he has netted from crime.</p>
        
            <p>The 52-year-old leader of the Tribal Huk gang, which is based in Ngaruawahia, will get to keep $22,700 and a 1994 Mitsubishi campervan after striking a deal with police.</p>
        
            <p>Pink was sentenced in December 2020 to seven years and four months in prison for a brazen attack on the gang's former sergeant-at-arms, Zion Coker, which happened on Ngaruawahia's main street in view of a crowd of locals.</p>
        
            <p>Coker was knocked to the ground, punched, kicked and hit with a claw hammer and an axe. He sustained serious injuries to both his knees and his left ankle, requiring surgery.</p>
        
            <p>Pink was later tried and convicted of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, his 84th conviction and his 26th for violent offending.</p>
        
            <p>Police estimate that Allan James Pink, known as Jamie, has made more than $1.6 million from his criminal activity, and have been pursuing him for the money under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009.</p>
        
            <p>The act allows authorities to seize cash and assets gained through crime, and have it forfeited to the Crown under a court order.</p>
        
            <p>Pink accepts that he has benefited through criminal activity, but not to the amount police sought.</p>
        
            <p>He also argued that assets the police seized three years ago - a total of $322,713 in cash, and the campervan - marked the limit of his capacity to satisfy any court forfeiture order.</p>
        
            <p>Pink and the police came to a deal in November last year, which has now been endorsed by Justice Grant Powell in the High Court at Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Powell ordered that $300,000 was the maximum amount recoverable from Pink under the act, and this should be paid over "in full and final settlement".</p>
        
            <p>However, he also ordered that the campervan and balance of the restrained cash, $22,713 plus any interest but minus any costs, should be returned to Pink.</p>
        
            <p>When Pink was sentenced in 2020, district court Judge Robert Spear described him as a "curious mixture of a person" who engaged in charity work alongside his gang activities.</p>
        
            <p>Through the Tribal Huk gang, he launched a lunch in schools programme which at one point was delivering 1000 meals a day, earning Tribal Huk the nickname of the "sandwich gang".</p>
        
            <p>He also held a Christmas Party for disadvantaged children in Ngaruawahia and gave cash to schools for drug education.</p>
