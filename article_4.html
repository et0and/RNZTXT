            <p>The government's plan for smokers to swap their cigarettes for free vapes in a bid to quit smoking has come underfire from respiratory advocates.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Health Minister Casey Costello said vaping starter kits would be supplied to stop-smoking services around the country from next week to help adults quit.</p>
        
            <p>She said vaping had played a key role in reducing smoking rates and she wanted to support adult smokers to switch to a product less harmful than cigarettes.</p>
        
            <p>But Asthma and Respiratory Foundation chief executive Letitia Harding said the use of vapes to quit cigarettes was controversial and the announcement came as a shock.</p>
        
            <p>"These products have not been approved for smoking cessation by the World Health Organisation, the FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration), or Medsafe here in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"So to have these basically handed out as a therapeutic product and not go through the proper rigourous process of consultation is really strange," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"And the fact they're rolling out next week just seems crazy."</p>
        
            <p>Harding said the plan was lacking in detail and simply shifted people from one product to another, with no clear exit strategy.</p>
        
            <p>"What products are actually going to be funded and then how are they actually going to get off nicotine addiction with vaping products in the long-term?</p>
        
            <p>"We could be sitting at a 'Vape Free Aotearoa" in a decade or couple of decades to come."</p>
