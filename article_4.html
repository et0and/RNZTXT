            <p>Significant fire safety defects and a highly combustible cladding mean residents of City Gardens Apartments on Albert St need to evacuate on short notice.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council has issued a Dangerous Building Notice for the building at 76 Albert St.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council field surveying manager Jeff Fahrensohn said residents had been advised on 12 April to vacate by midday on 22 April.</p>
        
            <p>"This follows visits by both council building inspectors and Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ) which found significant defects with the fire safety systems within the building," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Interim safety measures had been put in place, but residents would need to leave "if the safety issues have not been adequately resolved by then".</p>
        
            <p>A progress meeting on Thursday gave council "some confidence that works to make the building safer are progressing well", Fahrensohn said.</p>
        
            <p>Contractors were working on-site but there were still a number of remedial works yet to be completed, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will re-inspect again on Friday and are hopeful the remedial works will be completed to a stage where the DBN can be removed, avoiding the need for residents to evacuate."</p>

            <p>Fahrensohn said the notice would be "distressing for residents, however our priority is to keep building occupants safe".</p>
        
            <p>He urged building owners and body corporates to regularly inspect and maintain their building safety systems.</p>
        
            <p>Workers at the building said they started repairs three days ago.</p>
        
            <p>Council's notice orders the remedial work to be completed by 12 May.</p>
        
            <p>The order to vacate is also posted on the window at the entrance of the building.</p>
        
            <p>Next to it is a letter to the apartment's body corporate from Fire and Emergency dated 21 August 2023. It outlines a series of major safety concerns it has about the building.</p>
        
            <p>In the letter, FENZ said the building had not had a warrant of fitness since 2017, that it was unclear whether the building's fire alarms could reliably alert occupants to a fire, or that residents could reliably find the escape routes due to the condition of the signage.</p>
        
            <p>It also said the escape routes did not offer protection to anyone using them from a possible fire, and that it was unclear whether they could deliver water to the upper levels of the building in the event of a fire.</p>
        
            <p>An Auckland Council report found a fire exit door did not open, sprinklers did not trigger alarms for residents nor FENZ, and a malfunctioning alarm switch among other issues.</p>

            <p>One resident said the occupants were told they would need to vacate this weekend if the building did not pass fire testing on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>But another said they had been told they would be given an extra week to vacate if it failed the test.</p>
        
            <p>A third person, who has been living at the Albert Street tower for more than a year, said he was unaware of any order to vacate.</p>
        
            <p>However, he said living conditions at the apartment were poor, including a cockroach infestation, and the fire alarm frequently went off - up to six times a day.</p>
        
            <p>He had found a new place to live from next month.</p>
        
            <p>Due to extensive roadworks on Albert St, firefighters might struggle to access the building in the event of a fire.</p>
        
            <p>Back in 2018, the building was found to have the same type of highly combustible cladding with a polyethylene (non-fire resistant) core, as London's Grenfell Tower, where more than 70 people died in a rapid fire.</p>
