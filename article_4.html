        <p>

            <p>A legal bid by the Jehovah's Witness church challenging a ruling by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care has been dismissed by the Court of Appeal.</p>
        
            <p>At the Wellington court in March, the church appealed a High Court ruling that dismissed its claim to be excluded from the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Sarah Jerebine disputed the decision to broaden the scope of the inquiry from institutional care to trust-based relationships.</p>
        
            <p>She said the amendment was unlawful because it went beyond the original purpose of the inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>The Jehovah's Witness church maintains it should be exempt because it did not run institutions that cared for children or vulnerable people.</p>
        
            <p>The legal team representing the government and the commission argued extending the scope of the inquiry was not unusual.</p>
        
            <p>Andrew Butler KC said expanding the scope had benefited victims and was intended to allow survivors of any faith to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>In the Court of Appeal's judgment, Justice Cooke said the court did not accept the appellant's arguments.</p>
        
            <p>He said the commission was entitled to pursue the lines of inquiry that it did.</p>
        
            <p>"The only theoretical possibility that then remains would be an argument that the commission had acted unlawfully when initially obtaining information [from the Jehovah's Witnesses] prior to the amendment, and that this material cannot now be used by the commission in the report.</p>
        
            <p>"However, Ms Jerebine confirmed that no argument to that effect is advanced by the Jehovah's Witnesses."</p>
        
            <p>As for the second argument, Justice Cooke said the fact the church had argued its case in court twice showed its right to justice had not been taken away.</p>
        
            <p>He said the court did not accept the claim that the Crown had targeted the faith.</p>
        
            <p>"Rather, it is the Jehovah's Witnesses who have sought to single themselves out as a group who should be excluded from scrutiny by the inquiry, and they have done so notwithstanding the evidence of abuse committed by members of the church."</p>
        
            <p>The argument has been dismissed and the church must pay the government the costs for a standard appeal.</p>
