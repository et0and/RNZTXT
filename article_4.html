            <p>A South Auckland petrol station has been robbed, with a group smashing a glass window to get in.</p>
        
            <p>It is just the latest in a string of Auckland petrol station break-ins in recent weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Police said multiple offenders smashed a window to gain entry to the service station on Weymouth Road, Manurewa.</p>
        
            <p>The robbery was reported at 2.05am Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>One person was working at the time, but was not injured.</p>
        
            <p>Police said it would have been a distressing incident for the worker and asked anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers or 105, quoting the file number 240310/9889.</p>
        
            <p>Officers stepped up patrols of petrol stations this week after a spate of robberies in the Auckland region.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin said there had been five incidents across the city since Sunday - two aggravated robberies in Western Springs and Green Bay, and burglaries in Papatoetoe, Glen Eden and Remuera.</p>
        
            <p>The patrols were particularly focussed on petrol stations that operated 24 hours a day, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Like our community, police are appalled at some of the violent behaviour that has been inflicted on people just doing their job," Baldwin said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will continue to work to hold offenders to account that are inflicting harm on businesses and their employees."</p>
