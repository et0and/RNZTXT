            <p>The invasive pests, native to Australia, eat grass, native shrubs and trees, and can cause erosion issues and damage pastures.</p>
        
            <p>Environment Southland's biosecurity and biodiversity operations manager, Ali Meade, said staff were working on a plan with the Otago Regional Council, which had experts on how to deal with the animals because they have been in Otago for a couple of years.</p>
