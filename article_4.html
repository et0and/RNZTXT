            <p>Police have confirmed the remains found on a Greenpark farm on Tuesday belong to missing Christchurch real estate agent Yanfei Bao.</p>
        
            <p>The remains were exhumed from a shallow grave along a tree line and underwent a forensic post mortem on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Nicola Reeves said Bao's remains were accepted by the Coroner on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"This news brings to a close a key aspect of our investigation and Yanfei will now be returned to her family." Reeves said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they could not share any further details of the post mortem "in light of a pending court appearance of a 53-year-old charged with murder".</p>
        
            <p>The scene examination at the property Bao's remains were found at has been completed.</p>
        
            <p>Bao had been working at Harcourts. Managing director Bryan Thomson earlier said in a statement they had seen the news about remains being found and their thoughts were with her family, friends and colleagues.</p>
        
            <p>A 53-year-old Chinese national, Tingjun Cao, has been accused of her kidnapping and murder, with a trial date scheduled for October.</p>
        
            <p>Reeves earlier said police were "certainly not seeking anybody else in relation to Yanfei Bao's disappearance".</p>
        
            <p>Police will continue to prepare for trial and the one piece of the puzzle they did not have, they now do, Reeves said.</p>
