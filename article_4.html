            <p>A man has been charged with murder after a body was found in a burnt-out car in Hastings.</p>
        
            <p>The 30-year-old man was arrested mid-afternoon on Good Friday.</p>
        
            <p>He was due to appear in Hastings District Court on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>"While an arrest has been made, there are still a number of unanswered questions," detective inspector Martin James said.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe there are people in the community who have information that's of value to us; some may not realise it.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to speak with you if you have any information that could help us."</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services found the body after they were alerted to a burning car on Irongate Road about 8.40pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, police said they were treating the death as suspicious, and earlier on Friday, they launched a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"This is tragic for whƒÅnau and our Flaxmere community," Hastings Mayor Sandra Hazlehurst said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Now we need to leave police to get on with their work."</p>
        
            <p>James said formal identification of the victim was ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>He earlier labelled the alleged homicide an "abhorrent act" and said police were determined to hold those responsible to account.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information or CCTV footage was asked to contact police and "not take it into your own hands".</p>
        
            <p>People were urged to go to the Hastings Police Station, call 105, or make a report online at 105.police.govt.nz, using Update My Report and referencing file number 240327/2456.</p>
        
            <p>Information can also be provided anonymously via Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
