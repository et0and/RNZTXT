            <p>The police dive squad will be searching part of Christchurch's Avon River in relation to David Bridgwater's death.</p>
        
            <p>Bridgwater, 38, died earlier this month on Carisbrooke Street in Aranui of gunshot wounds.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation, Operation Walter, was launched shortly after.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Detective Senior Sergeant Colin Baillie said a firearm is one of a number of items of interest being looked for as part of the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"Several people have been spoken to and, as the investigation continues, we expect to speak with a number of others and carry out further searches in other areas of interest.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committed to thoroughly investigating the death of Mr Bridgwater."</p>

            <p>Baillie said the thoughts of police were with his family, including his mother, brother and children who are still searching for answers about his death.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, a 51-year-old woman was arrested and charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder.</p>
        
            <p>According to court documents, she was charged with "actively suppressing evidence by preventing access to CCTV data".</p>
        
            <p>She was granted name suppression and remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>Her next court appearance was scheduled for February.</p>
        
            <p>Police asked anyone who had information relating to the investigation to contact them on 105 and reference Operation Walter.</p>
        
            <p>Information could also be provided anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
