            <p>A Taranaki geriatrician believes the availability of the free shingles vaccine should be expanded.</p>
        
            <p>Shingles is a viral infection caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus - the same disease which causes chickenpox.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, the first of two doses can be accessed for free by those aged 65 - but only until their 66th birthday - after that people have to pay for it themselves.</p>
        
            <p>It is also free for people 18 and over with specific medical conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Taranaki geriatrician Dr Tyson Oberndorfer told Nine to Noon for those over the age of 85 the risk of developing shingles was one in two people.</p>
        
            <p>The disease could cause nerve pain which ranged from lasting for weeks to the rest of someone's life, Dr Oberndorfer said. It could also cause vision loss, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The most recent shingles vaccine had an effectiveness of about 90 percent, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Oberndorfer believed Pharmac should increase the age range of people able to access to the vaccine due to elderly people being the most vulnerable to getting the virus.</p>
        
            <p>"I strongly believe that they should further expand funding to all adults who are 65 years and older."</p>
        
            <p>Grey Power national secretary Jo Millar told Nine to Noon people in their 70s who got shingles generally spent four days in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"To me, this seems ridiculous. A hospital cost is about $8700 a day and four days we're looking at over $30,000."</p>
        
            <p>Providing the shingles vaccine to more people for free could save money for the health system, Millar said.</p>
        
            <p>She believed hundreds of people were missing out on getting the vaccine due to the limitations around eligibility to the free vaccine.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>In April, Pharmac announced it would widen access, from 1 July 2024, to the shingles vaccine for some immunocompromised people aged 18 years or older.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be no other changes to age eligibility criteria for Shingrix at this time, meaning that it will remain funded for all other people aged 65 years."</p>
        
            <p>On its website, Pharmac also said it was seeking clinical advice or assessing other applications on the shingles vaccine, including one for all people over the age of 65.</p>
