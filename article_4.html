        <h2>Why red seaweed has blanketed beaches</h2>
        <p>
Masses of red "hair-like" seaweed has covered beaches on Auckland's Hibiscus Coast.
</p>
        
            <p>Thick red seaweed that has covered beaches on Auckland's Hibiscus Coast is a natural occurrence, experts say, but locals remain convinced they haven't seen it before.</p>
        
            <p>Both Ōrewa and Red Beach have been covered in the hair-like seaweed since the beginning of the week.</p>
        
            <p>The thick layering of seaweed was "beginning to smell" at Ōrewa Beach, Hibiscus Coast resident Scott Douglas said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been accumulating all week - it was worse when it first appeared in the water because it would stick to your body while swimming.</p>
        
            <p>"I have no idea what sort of seaweed it could be. I've lived here for a year and never seen it before."</p>

            <p>Members of the public contacted Biosecurity New Zealand about the seaweed, team leader of aquatic health Rissa Williams confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a type of polysiphonia, a common genus of seaweed in New Zealand," Williams said. "There's been similar reports at beaches in previous summers".</p>
        
            <p>But Ōrewa resident Houshang Radkhou - who has lived in the area for a decade - said it was the first time he had ever seen seaweed like it.</p>

            <p>"It's beautiful - I've never seen it like this before, normally any seaweed that has washed up is green. I did have a close look at it and checked inside and it looked green in the middle but red outside."</p>
        
            <p>Fellow Ōrewa local Alan Flint agreed with Radkhou that he had not seen seaweed like it at the beach before but he said it was "a bit of an eyesore".</p>
        
            <p>"I'll be glad when it finally gets washed away. It's looking better than it did a couple of days ago though, the whole beach was covered."</p>

            <p>The tide had pushed the seaweed further up the bank, Flint said, and it was now piled up by the steps which lead on to the beach.</p>
        
            <p>Algae goes through blooms, lead environmental scientist at Auckland Council, Dr Megan Carbines said, and warmer sea temperatures over the past two years had increased growth.</p>

            <p>The accumulation of the red seaweed was likely due to that along with some onshore winds pushing it up, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The seaweed will disperse as the temperatures continue to cool and wind conditions change."</p>
        
            <p>As marine heat waves and increasingly warm temperatures continued, Carbines said it was likely Aotearoa would see more of these events in the future.</p>
        
            <p>University of Auckland associate professor of marine science Dr Nick Shears backed this up and said calm conditions and warm weather were perfect conditions for red algae to grow.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not 100 percent sure why these events are becoming more common, but obviously we have had fairly rapid warming conditions over the last decade."</p>
