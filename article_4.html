            <p>The Education Review Office (ERO) has found that most,, but not all, schools are teaching reading, writing and maths for at least an hour a day each.</p>
        
            <p>The government introduced the requirement for schools with students in years 0-8 last year.</p>
        
            <p>The ERO told RNZ it visited 685 primary schools last year and found 11 were not meeting the hour-a-day requirement - about 2 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It said school boards were expected to attest to whether their school was meeting the rule.</p>
        
            <p>"School boards attest to their compliance with the hour-a-day rules (Board Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklists), which we check during ERO's regular review process," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Part of our enquiry includes inspection of the school's plans, programmes and their assessment of student progress and achievement in reading, writing and mathematics."</p>
        
            <p>The review office said it expected schools to comply with any recommendations it made in school review reports within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
        
            <p>"ERO reports any non-compliance to the Ministry of Education."</p>
        
            <p>The Principals Federation said schools were already teaching reading, writing and maths for at least an hour a day before the government introduced the rule.</p>
