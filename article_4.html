            <p>Five people are facing charges, as a result of the police investigation into the drug supply activities of the Comanchero motorcycle gang.</p>
        
            <p>Police said further phases of Operation Leith, a sub-operation of Operation Avon, had been underway and four men and a woman, were arrested as a result of recent search warrants.</p>
        
            <p>The group, aged from 35 to 63, were not members of the Comancheros, however were integral parts of their drug supply network, police said.</p>
        
            <p>They face charges of methamphetamine supply and participating in organised criminal group offences.</p>
        
            <p>Two homemade tasers and several electronic devices were also seized, police said.</p>
        
            <p>It brings the total number of people arrested and charged in relation to Operation Avon and Leith to 31.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Nicola Reeves said numerous reports indicated recent police action had significantly disrupted the supply of illicit drugs into Invercargill and Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>"Community members have approached our teams to express their praise for the recent arrests and results.</p>
        
            <p>"The termination of Operation Leith is a clear message to gang members, their associates and anyone dealing drugs in Southern District that we will track you down and hold you to account for your offending," she said.</p>
