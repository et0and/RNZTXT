            <p>Police and the Conservation Department (DOC) are investigating vandalism of pou whenua along the Abel Tasman Coast Track.</p>
        
            <p>The pou whenua - carved posts marking out boundaries or places of significance to Māori - were at Medlands Beach, close to Bark Bay, and at Marahau. The sites have since been closed.</p>
        
            <p>DOC acting operations manager Phil Crawford said the department and mana whenua were extremely disappointed and were working with police to track down those responsible.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard to believe someone would vandalise cultural pieces like this along a Great Walk," Crawford said.</p>
        
            <p>"The first pou whenua looks as though someone took a hammer to it and paint was thrown over the second."</p>
        
            <p>Crawford described the damage as mindless acts of destruction.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, we're not sure which is stranger - that someone would do something like this, or that they planned enough to bring a hammer and paint along to do it."</p>
        
            <p>A lot of people are on the track at this time of the year and Crawford was hopeful someone might have seen something and could pass information on to authorities.</p>
        
            <p>One pou whenua is of Hohāia Rangiāuru, an important Te Ātiawa chief of Motueka. An online hui was held Monday where Hohāia's descendants expressed sadness at the vandalism.</p>
        
            <p>Mana whenua plan to visit and perform karakia at the site to impose a rāhui and the site will be tapu until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information should contact the DOC hotline on 0800 362 468 or NZ Police on 105.</p>
