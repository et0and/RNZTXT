            <p>Anglican church leaders have agreed to reduce the seismic strengthening of Christ Church Cathedral to lessen a $114 million shortfall.</p>
        
            <p>The cost of restoring the quake-damaged cathedral has blown out to almost $250 million.</p>
        
            <p>Anglican Bishop Dr Peter Carrell said Saturday's agreement cut the funding gap to $85 million.</p>
        
            <p>That shortfall assumed further fundraising and a contribution from the church. A proposal to inject $16.2 million by selling off church land and buildings was also agreed.</p>
        
            <p>Carrell said the six-hour synod meeting reaffirmed the church's commitment to rebuilding the cathedral.</p>
        
            <p>"We agreed to a funding pathway which could see $16.2 million of new funds injected into the cathedral project."</p>

            <p>The recommendation by Christ Church Cathedral Reinstatement Ltd to remove other elements of the concept design was also accepted, he added.</p>
        
            <p>"We also agreed to support the acceptance of some reduction in scope of the project, in particular that the seismic rating of the building might drop from a 100 percent of new building standard to 67 percent of new building standard."</p>
        
            <p>CCRL chair Mark Stewart said he was heartened by the support from the synod.</p>
        
            <p>"The project, as originally agreed [between the church, government, and council] is no longer attainable. The decisions made by synod will make a major difference to the overall project cost and demonstrate good will for upcoming discussions with council and government."</p>
        
            <p>Carrell said the discussion was "robust at times but the synod as a whole was deeply engaged in every matter put to it" and he was "relieved" by the outcome.</p>
        
            <p>He said the project could now finish two years earlier than forecast.</p>
        
            <p>Original estimates put the completion date at 2031.</p>
        
            <p>But Carrell said the cathedral's completion was still not guaranteed.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm confident but there's no certainty until we know that we can bridge that particular $85 million funding gap.</p>
        
            <p>"We will all need to work together. This is only the first element of a solution. We cannot do this alone."</p>
