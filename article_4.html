            <p>As Anzac Day approaches, RSAs and council services across the country are preparing to pay tribute to those who served and gave their lives to war.</p>
        
            <p>At the first light of dawn, New Zealanders will gather at their local war memorial to commemorate the day, participating in various civic ceremonies, wreath-laying, and community events to pay their respects.</p>
        
            <p>Each year, 25 April draws large crowds in major centres, such as Auckland's War Memorial Museum or Christchurch's Cathedral Square. This year, some regions are offering hot breakfasts, hero workouts, and choir performances as part of the day's events.</p>
        
            <p>Here is how you can mark the day in your town.</p>
        
            <p>The traditional commemorations will take place at Laurie Hall Park from 6am. The public is also welcome to join the Te Kamo community Anzac service at 10am, which includes wreath-laying and morning tea.</p>
        
            <p>The Anzac Day Dawn Service will be held at Auckland War Memorial Museum in the Auckland Domain at 6am. The museum's commemorative events also include a centennial choir performance and remembrance tours, open to the public for free until 5pm.</p>
        
            <p>Outside the museum, you can visit the Field of Remembrance, which honours the fallen New Zealand soldiers from all war and conflicts from 1845-2012.</p>
        
            <p>Vector lights on the Auckland Harbour Bridge will be lit up in poppy-red from 5am-7am to usher in Anzac Day morning.</p>
        
            <p>Later in the day, the New Zealand Warbirds Association will be doing a flyover across Tāmaki Makaurau in their trademark billowing smoke.</p>

            <p>Both dawn and civic Anzac Day memorial services take place at the Cenotaph in Memorial Park from 6am.

            <p>On the corner of Memorial Drive and Anzac Parade, more than 5000 poppies and 350 white crosses have been installed to acknowledge the Hamiltonians lost in the conflict.</p>
