            <p>Officials say a rescue at Muriwai Beach is a timely reminder of how quickly conditions in and around the water can change.</p>
        
            <p>Police Auckland maritime unit Senior Sergeant Garry Larsen said a trio had a lucky escape after walking around the rocks to the left of the beach to collect mussels.</p>
        
            <p>One of the group was able to get back to the beach and called for help - alerting police to two women trapped in a small cave by the incoming tide.</p>
        
            <p>They were spotted by a police helicopter and surf lifeguards were directed to their location who helped them along the rocks and back to safety.</p>
        
            <p>"Thankfully they were unharmed, but it's a timely reminder about how these situations can change in an instant," Larsen said.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was important to be aware of the risks heading into spring as the water got warmer and the evenings lighter.</p>
        
            <p>The group headed out at low tide and thought they had time to get back to the beach, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"What may seem like a safe area can become a dangerous and risky location faster than you might realise so we encourage everyone choosing to be in and around the water to have a safety plan in mind."</p>
        
            <p>Search and rescue coordinator at the Muriwai Volunteer Lifeguard Service, Glenn Gowthorpe, said their lifeguards saved the lives of two people.</p>
        
            <p>"The tide was halfway in, with just 45 minutes of daylight remaining, and the spot they were standing would have been pounded by the 2.5m swell within about an hour's time, with no means of escape."</p>
