            <p>Christchurch City Council has given $125,000 to this year's Christchurch Show and the same amount is earmarked to underwrite next year's show.</p>
        
            <p>Papanui ward councillor Victoria Henstock said the revelation during a briefing to councillors from Canterbury A&P Association board members this morning took her by surprise.</p>
        
            <p>The news came after the council reached a $5 million deal with the association in April, which would see the association surrender its lease on council land on Wigram Road and receive $4m in a protected investment fund.</p>
        
            <p>"Was it anticipated at that time there would be additional funding going to the show?" Henstock questioned after the board members told councillors - apparently for the first time - it had provided funding for this year's show.</p>
        
            <p>The money had come from the council's city identity fund, a staff member told Henstock.</p>
        
            <p>It had been a tumultuous year for the Canterbury A&P Association.</p>
        
            <p>The board announced in April that this year's New Zealand Agricultural Show was cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>The show was then resurrected - though in a downscaled and different format - by an events management company and most of the board retired.</p>
        
            <p>This morning's briefing to councillors marked the first time the new board had fronted councillors since their appointment.</p>
        
            <p>Board member Peter Engel said the $125,000 funding for this year and the underwriting for next year would support the show's viability until returns started coming in from the protected investment fund.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch City Council citizens and community general manager Andrew Rutledge would be an observer and adviser to the association's board.</p>
        
            <p>The board's chair Sir David Carter said he was certain this year's show - branded the Christchurch Show - was going ahead and that was the board's focus.</p>
        
            <p>"What we're keen to do as a board is put the past behind us. There's no point in post-mortems - the past is the past. What we want to focus on is Show 24 and Show 25," he said.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ had asked the council for further clarity around the funding to the Canterbury A&P Association.</p>
