        <h2>Braille surtitles for opera 'life-changing'</h2>
        <p>
A blind person who was the first braille reader to test the technology said surtitles will make a huge difference for blind and low-vision audience members.

            <p>A blind person and life-long braille reader has called NZ Opera offering braille surtitles at its shows "life-changing."</p>
        
            <p>Braille surtitles would be available at all performances of Rossini's Le comte Ory, taking place throughout June.</p>
        
            <p>New technology - which sends surtitles to users' personal braille-reading machines as the action unfolds on stage - was trialled last week during the Auckland season of Le comte Ory.</p>
        
            <p>Audio Described Aotearoa co-director Paul Brown, who was the first braille reader to test the technology, said surtitles would make a huge difference for blind and low-vision audience members.</p>
        
            <p>Audio description was helpful, but he would prefer not to listen to the opera and audio description simultaneously, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I could follow for the first time what was happening at the opera without having to listen to something else."</p>
        
            <p>Brown said he was pleased to have braille recognised by a major arts company and for people to have the choice of surtitles, audio description, or both.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Opera general director Brad Cohen believed it was a world-first to provide this sort of accessibility during a live performance.</p>
        
            <p>The braille reader program - called contexts.live, and developed by Cohen and colleague Hugh Glaser - would replace NZ Opera's existing PowerPoint system.</p>
        
            <p>"We are committed to doing it for every show. It is not just a one-off for us."</p>
        
            <p>NZ Opera wanted to share the technology with other opera and theatre companies, and eventually other mediums, Cohen said.</p>
        
            <p>"The application of this goes beyond opera. Not just theatre but TV, film, and other media."</p>
        
            <p>In addition to braille surtitles, Audio Described Aotearoa would continue to describe select performances. A free Touch Tour of the set, some costumes, and key props were also held two hours before audio-described shows, which were open to all audience members.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Opera hoped to have audio description and special events available for all shows in the near future, Cohen said.</p>
        
            <p>"We want blind and low-vision customers to come to the opera whenever they want and get the same experience as any other customer."</p>
        
            <p>Le comte Ory is on at Wellington's St James Theatre on 13 June and 15 June, then at Christchurch's Isaac Theatre Royal on 27 June and 29 June.</p>
