            <p>An 11-year-old boy has been arrested after throwing rocks at an elderly man on Auckland's North Shore.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were aware of the incident on Anzac Road in Browns Bay on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>They had noted the large amount of discussion the original post of the attack had generated on social media.</p>
        
            <p>Posted anonymously on a community Facebook page, residents have voiced their outrage at the boy's actions.</p>
        
            <p>One user described it as absolutely disgraceful and disrespectful behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"I wonder how these kids would like to sit anywhere and have stones thrown at them!!" one wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"This didn't happen back in the day because kids were disciplined," said another.</p>
        
            <p>Hibiscus and Bays local board member Julia Parfitt said the community came together to alert authorities.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm also told that the police response was extremely swift," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"And that was because we've got those eyes and ears out there in our community, who contact the police and ensure that everyone else is safer."</p>
        
            <p>Parfitt said there did not appear to be any motivation for the attack.</p>
        
            <p>"Christmas is quite a stressful time of the year for many people," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know what the young person's motivation was - it doesn't sound like there was any motivation does it.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a random thing, and really awful..."</p>
        
            <p>"It just shows you that when you can, though, work together, and if you do use those police contact numbers, that you can get a swift response."</p>
        
            <p>Police also responded on social media, saying they had arrested an 11-year-old boy.</p>
        
            <p>"Police share your concerns about this unacceptable behaviour," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our Browns Bay community officers have since identified the young boy involved, an 11-year-old, and he has been apprehended."</p>
        
            <p>The boy was being dealt with through Youth Aid, police said.</p>
