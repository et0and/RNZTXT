            <p>The crash is still under investigation, but drugs or alcohol may have been a factor, police said.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday afternoon, police said two people remained in a serious condition in hospital after the car mounted the footpath outside the university's engineering school building.</p>
        
            <p>Another person had been discharged while two others were treated at the scene although police said they were not able to confirm whether there were students involved.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the day, St John said it transported three people, two in moderate conditions and one in a serious condition, to Auckland City Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>They also treated one person at the scene who did not need to be hospitalised.</p>
        
            <p>The University of Auckland said it was offering support to staff and students affected by the crash.</p>
        
            <p>Stephen Dimapilis, a university student who witnessed the crash, said he saw the car coming down Symonds street and "swerving" in the way it was driven, before it hit pedestrians on the pavement.</p>
        
            <p>"I see a car coming out of control, and then he crashed into two people and one person was under the car, and the other person - I saw him literally flying. So I was just speechless I didn't know what to think of."</p>

            <p>He said the two injured people he saw appeared like they were in their 20s.</p>
        
            <p>"Honestly, I was just speechless and I didn't know what to think of, but all im gonna say is like God bless NZ, because that could've been me or someone, a person that I love," he said.</p>

            <p>Dimapilis said the car appeared to be driving above the 40kph speed limit on Symonds Street.</p>
        
            <p>Symonds Street was closed between Wellesley Street and Grafton Road, and diversions were in place with police still at the scene.</p>
