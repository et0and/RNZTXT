            <p>For nearly three decades beagles have been sniffing luggage at airports and sea ports nationwide, and a group of Auckland owners think the scent hounds are so special they're part of a club.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Beagle Club has been running fo 40 years and every six weeks they gather together for a walk.</p>
        
            <p>When RNZ's First Up programme joined them at Auckland Domain there were about 30 dogs and their owners.</p>
        
            <p>Club president Ray Linton Brown said it was an ageing club, but he was grateful for the social aspect.</p>
        
            <p>He and his wife, Sandra, have three beagles of their own, and also dog-sit for others.</p>
        
            <p>She said they've had up to 11 in the house before.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great a dinner time, you're going around from one bowl to the next.</p>
        
            <p>"They're very intelligent dogs, and they can keep you on your toes but you've got to be firm with them, but they pay back all that love and everything ten-fold, they're just a lovely breed of dog."</p>

            <p>Naughty Morty was there too, he's a dropout from the MPI detector dog programme.</p>
        
            <p>"He didn't quite meet the programme, but he's a wonderful boy, he's very enthusiastic."</p>
        
            <p>Hamiltonian Gavon left home at 7am to make it to the Auckland meet with two-year-old Neo.</p>
        
            <p>"We try to make every [meeting] if we can, if it ties in with other family stuff and we're available."</p>

            <p>Karen Staniland is somewhat of a celebrity in the Beagle world, despite now owning Jack Russells instead.</p>
        
            <p>"We got our first beagle in 1974 and we've had beagles all the way through until two and a half years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"They're fun, they're intelligent and I did obedience with two of them and they did quite well at it but you have to be boss, and if you're not boss, beagle can really give you a run-around."</p>

            <p>Karen initiated the walks in 1994 and still shows up to walk with the beagles.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really nice, it's a social thing for people and for the dogs, and beagles are pack animals so they like getting together."</p>

            <p>The walk wound its way up in front of the museum, where the beagles and their owners proudly posed for pictures.</p>
        
            <p>Then it was back to start for a cuppa.</p>
