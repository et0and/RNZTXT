            <p>One hundred wild kiwi will be released into the hills around Wellington from later this month.</p>
        
            <p>Capital Kiwi Project founder Paul Ward told Morning Report they'll join the 63 already moved to the Capital since 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really exciting and we're deeply stoaked to receive that permit from DOC [Department of Conservation] to move that number of birds, it's quite radical in terms of pace an scale in growing a kiwi population."</p>
        
            <p>The birds were from Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari in Waikato and the first were due to arrive on 18 March.</p>
        
            <p>"With the support of the Wellington Aeroclub they're coming down in a squadron of light aircraft to Wellington Airport so we've got some flying kiwi arriving on the hills," Ward said.</p>
        
            <p>There would be further flights on 19 and 20 March, with the remainder of the birds arriving in April and March.</p>
        
            <p>Ward said the birds that had arrived to date were doing well - putting on weight and breeding.</p>
        
            <p>"There are kiwi running around out there 10 minutes from the CBD really so it's pretty sweet."</p>
        
            <p>It showed what the community, iwi and landowners could achieve together, he said.</p>
        
            <p>A network of 4600 traps from Red Rocks on the south coast to Porirua in the north help protect the birds, Ward said.</p>
