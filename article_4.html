            <p>A worker viciously beaten in a random attack in Auckland's CBD says he been off work for months with a litany of injuries and is now constantly looking over his shoulder.</p>
        
            <p>At a law and order meeting in the city this week, a number of central city Aucklanders told Police Minister Mark Mitchell they do not feel safe and want more feet on the beat.</p>
        
            <p>The minister and police say foot patrols have increased and crime in the CBD is now slowly trending down.</p>
        
            <p>But "horrific" is how a top Auckland developer described the situation to Checkpoint, saying safety in the city needs to be prioritised.</p>
        
            <p>Chris takes care of some of the city's trees and was working in Aotea Square when he was viciously attacked in January by a man who had allegedly made violent threats against others in the days leading up to the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Chris told Checkpoint he enacted his company's protocol when the man appeared, picking up anything that could be used as a potential weapon, because of his alleged threatening nature earlier in the week.</p>
        
            <p>He closed security fences and went to his vehicle where he was tidying things up.</p>
        
            <p>"He approached, calm as anything, moved the security barrier, walked through and walked directly up to me. As he approached me, I backed away from him but I stepped off a step I was parked behind and so I looked to see where I was stepping and he king-punched me and then proceeded to keep punching me. He had me by the scruff of the neck, my work shirt, and just repeatedly continued to punch me in the head.</p>
        
            <p>"I funnily enough started counting and I think I got to nine or 10 and then the next thing, I was on the ground. I was sort-of in foetal position, and he was above me, still hitting me in the head and the neck."</p>
        
            <p>Chris managed to get away from the man, and fell over fencing and he ran to safety.</p>
        
            <p>He said the man followed him across the square, "mouthing off".</p>
        
            <p>Chris said it was a terrifying ordeal.</p>
        
            <p>"I just felt so vulnerable and so helpless."</p>
        
            <p>Chris claimed it took police about 45 minutes to arrive at the scene and a work colleague of his was upset by their lack or urgency.</p>
        
            <p>He was left with a broken eye socket, nerve trauma in his left arm and a knee injury from falling over the fencing as he tried to get away from the man.</p>
        
            <p>Chris had only just returned to work following the attack - and said he hated working in the central city.</p>
        
            <p>By the end of the day, he said he was agitated, on edge and stressed.</p>
        
            <p>He worried for other contractors who worked solo and were exposed to potential harm every day.</p>
        
            <p>Chris said security measures had improved - but he wanted to see a stronger police presence.</p>
        
            <p>A man has been charged in relation to the assault.</p>
