            <p>The Independent Police Conduct Authority has found an officer was justified in shooting at a man during a lengthy firearms incident in Stratford last year.</p>
        
            <p>In March 2023, a man police were seeking to arrest was involved in a car chase in the Taranaki town.</p>
        
            <p>He shot at police before abandoning his vehicle and hunkering down in a nearby house.</p>
        
            <p>At the house, he again pointed a gun at police.</p>
        
            <p>An officer then fired three shots at the man which missed.</p>
        
            <p>He eventually surrendered to police the next day, about 14 hours after he first entered the house.</p>
        
            <p>Central District Commander Superintendent Scott Fraser acknowledged the authority's finding that the decision to shoot was justified under the Crimes Act, as the officer was acting in defence of himself and others around him.</p>
        
            <p>"This was a lengthy and demanding incident, where a firearm was both presented at police and discharged."</p>
        
            <p>Fraser said his officers had to act in a way to protect not only themselves, but the public.</p>
        
            <p>"Due to the duration of this incident, specialist staff from within the district as well as outside of the district were called to assist.</p>
        
            <p>"I am incredibly proud of their efforts, in a situation that lasted for a significant period of time, the responding staff did everything they could to reach a resolution without any harm."</p>
        
            <p>He said the decision to discharge a firearm was one that no police officer ever wanted to make.</p>
        
            <p>"This further shows how unpredictable these jobs can be, within a matter of time, lives can be at risk."</p>
