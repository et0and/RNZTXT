            <p>Four people have been arrested after a raid on two central Auckland apartments that were found packed full of stolen loot, with more than 80 items recovered, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The two apartments were both in the same Hobson Street complex and were searched on Wednesday morning, Auckland Central Area Commander Inspector Grant Tetzlaff said.</p>
        
            <p>Items found included electronics, tools, and a collection of electric scooters.</p>
        
            <p>The raid was the result of an investigation into a series of burglaries at businesses and apartments in the city that took place in the past month, Tetzlaff said.</p>
        
            <p>"Inside our teams came across an Aladdin's cave of stolen property and it's going to take some time to work through where everything has come from."</p>
        
            <p>The four people arrested were all found at the apartments. They include two men, aged 28 and 36; and two women, aged 35 and 41.</p>
        
            <p>Tetzlaff said the charges laid relate to two burglaries in March, one at a Wellesley Street business, and one at a Union Street apartment.</p>
        
            <p>However, some of the power tools found in the search warrants had been connected to a 2019 North Shore burglary, he said.</p>
        
            <p>
Police said they found 13 stolen electric scooters in the search of the two apartments.

            <p>The 41-year-old woman and 28-year-old man each face two charges of burglary, while the 28-year-old man was also charged with the aggravated robbery of an electric scooter - relating to an incident in January.</p>
        
            <p>The 36-year-old man and 35-year-old woman were charged with receiving stolen goods.</p>
        
            <p>All four are expected to appear at Auckland District Court.</p>
        
            <p>"Burglary is a serious offence and brings with it a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment," Tetzlaff said.</p>
        
            <p>"The team working on Operation Rocket are continuing with their enquiries and further charges cannot be ruled out at this stage."</p>
