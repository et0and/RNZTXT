            <p>Aucklanders will soon have to stump up more cash to park in some public places.</p>
        
            <p>From 14 April, Auckland Transport (AT), was upping its parking prices by 50 cents an hour.</p>
        
            <p>Before the blanket change, in AT's paid parking areas, the price to park varied between $0.50 to $6.00 for a single hour, depending on where in the region you parked.</p>
        
            <p>In some busier places, the cost of parking for additional hours was almost double.</p>
        
            <p>AT parking services manager John Strawbridge said demand for parking across the city remained high.</p>
        
            <p>He said the cost for AT to run and maintain the city's parking had increased and it needed more money to fund services without increasing rates.</p>
        
            <p>"Our operational costs have gone up by 13 percent, and we are responding to approximately 30 percent more requests from Aucklanders to respond to issues that are frustrating them, such as blocked driveways, footpaths, and clearways.</p>
        
            <p>"We've also been investing in technology infrastructure and compliance tools to ensure parking spaces are used as intended and we are responsive to issues on the network.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland Council is striving to keep rate increases low, and a small increase in parking prices is one way we are supporting this."</p>
        
            <p>AT's parking prices last increased in August 2023, by $1 an hour.</p>
        
            <p>Some areas of the city that had already seen a recent price increase including Devonport, Westgate, Eden Terrace South, Freemans Bay, Edgerley Ave in Parnell, and McNaughton Way and Delta Avenue in New Lynn, would be excluded from the change.</p>
