            <p>A man has been arrested and charged after a bus driver was punched in the face and left needing stitches and dental surgery.</p>
        
            <p>Roskill depot-based Rajnish Trehan was hit by a man who wouldn't pay on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the bus was travelling through Avondale on Saturday and stopped on Great North Road to pick up passengers.</p>
        
            <p>A person allegedly attempted to board the bus without paying and was challenged by the driver.</p>
        
            <p>The driver was assaulted and the attacker left the scene on foot, police said.</p>
        
            <p>A man matching the description of the attacker was found in Avondale on Sunday, Inspector Wayne Kitcher said.</p>
        
            <p>"On seeing police, he attempted to evade staff by boarding a nearby bus and hiding down the back," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our staff boarded and arrested the man without further incident."</p>
        
            <p>A 36-year-old from West Harbour has been charged with assault and due to appear in Auckland District Court on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"No one deserves to come to work and be subjected to harm just for doing their job," Kitcher said.</p>
        
            <p>Tramways Auckland union president Gary Froggatt told Morning Report members were now pushing for a stop work meeting, which he acknowledged would cause disruption across the city.</p>
