            <p>Water testing has started in the settlement of Norsewood, in the hope a boil water notice can be lifted, Tararua District Council says.</p>
        
            <p>The council issued the notice for water from the Norsewood public supply on Wednesday, after it found there might not be enough chlorine present to meet drinking standards, due to a fault at its treatment plant.</p>
        
            <p>Dozen of households are affected.</p>
        
            <p>A council spokesperson said the fault at the plant has now been fixed.</p>
        
            <p>Once the council has three consecutive days of clear test samples, it will be able to lift the boil water notice.</p>
