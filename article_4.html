            <p>A man has been taken into custody in Christchurch after making threats which led to a number of homes being evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Monday, a police cordon was in place in the suburb of Sydenham and nearby houses and businesses were evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>"The address will now be cleared as a precaution to ensure there is no ongoing risk to the public before cordons are stood down," police said in an update on Monday evening.</p>
        
            <p>"Police would like to thank the Sydenham community for their patience and understanding as we worked through the afternoon to resolve this safely for all."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Monday, nearby residents have told RNZ there had been a bomb threat.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were called to an address on Percival St about 10.40am to reports a person was making threats.</p>
        
            <p>As a precaution, police evacuated people from adjacent properties and a cordon of approximately 100m is in place around the Percival Street address.</p>
        
            <p>People are asked to stay clear until the situation can be safely resolved.</p>

            <p>Tennyson Street resident Leon said police told him there had been a bomb threat, and he was asked to move to Colombo Street.</p>
        
            <p>Some Colombo Street businesses near the scene have also been evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>A shop owner who did not wish to be named told RNZ there had been rumours of a potential bomb around the area.</p>
        
            <p>"We were told to evacuate the building as quickly as possible and go at least 100 metres away and that was all the information we'd heard," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Evacuated cafe worker Aidan Mytton said the situation was scary.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never had to experience anything like this before. It's a little frightening I guess but everyone's evacuated so that make me feel a bit safer."</p>
        
            <p>Another business owner, who did not wish to be named, told RNZ she could see at least a dozen police officers and a police dog.</p>
        
            <p>"Quite a lot of us just standing round on Colombo Street evacuated, it's been going on for over an hour now," she said.</p>

            <p>She said people were concerned about their properties and wondering what was going on.</p>
        
            <p>A cafe owner told RNZ they did not know when they would be able to go back inside.</p>
        
            <p>A woman who lived nearby on Beckenham St said the area was generally safe.</p>
        
            <p>"We've heard there were threats in the area and we just saw lots of police cars and fire trucks at the end of our street," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is concerning because it's not something you hear about happening in this area."</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said they were assisting police.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands residents were being let back into their homes within the cordon shortly before 6pm.</p>
