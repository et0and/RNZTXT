            <p>Auckland commuters are facing major delays after a crash blocked two lanes on the Northwestern Motorway.</p>
        
            <p>The crash occurred just before 6:35am just prior to the St Lukes Rd overbridge. It has now been fully cleared and all lanes reopened, but NZTA is warning of long delays.</p>
        
            <p>Queues are backed up to Westgate, where Google Maps predicts a commute of 1 hour 28 to the CBD.</p>
        
            <p>An earlier crash in the northbound lanes of the Southern motorway near Princes St at around 6:25am has since been cleared.</p>
        
            <p>Wednesday's incidents follow a five-vehicle crash in the same area of the Northwestern motorway at around the same time on Monday morning, just as 'March madness' begins.</p>
        
            <p>The crash came on the first day of an expected spike in traffic known as 'March madness', as students returned to university.</p>

            <p>Auckland was also in the midst of rail closures.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport group manager of public transport operations Rachel Cara said the public transport network was ready to help ease the strain.</p>
        
            <p>"We're well prepared for this increase in demand and we've been planning for it," Cara said.</p>
        
            <p>"Auckland has a well connected, frequent public transport system that can handle the increased number of people that need to travel during March."</p>
