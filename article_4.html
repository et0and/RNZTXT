            <p>Extra police are on patrol in Ōtara for the gang funeral of the man police say fatally shot a pedestrian on Auckland's Ponsonby Road.</p>
        
            <p>Police also kept a close eye on gang members, as Hone Kay-Selwyn's body was moved across the city on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Kay-Selwyn, who belonged to the Killer Beez gang, shot dead Robert Horne eight days ago, after being denied entry to a bar, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The pair did not know each other and Kay-Selwyn, who was 31, was found dead on a rural property near Taupō last Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>His body was taken from Massey in West Auckland to the Manukau Memorial Gardens in Ōtara for his funeral on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said a number of resources were being deployed to monitor proceedings, including around the route and at the Manukau Memorial Gardens.</p>
        
            <p>"The operation on the ground today will be supported by the Air Support Unit and there will be a checkpoint established at the cemetery."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said police expectations around acceptable behaviour in recent days had not changed.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone concerned about any activity or behaviour they are seeing should report this to police so that appropriate action can be taken."</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said on Sunday there had been no reports of problems.</p>
