            <p>Police are still hunting for the man they believe is responsible for stealing cash from a van as security staff were stocking up an ATM on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Detective Inspector Simon Harrison said the cash in transit van was robbed in Birkenhead just before 2.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Security staff were carrying out a delivery to the ATM on Birkenhead Ave, he said, when a man approached them and stole a case of cash.</p>
        
            <p>No one was injured and the man fled on foot, but it was believed he then left in a car.</p>
        
            <p>The amount of money stolen has not yet been confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>The brazen robbery shocked the community which is still reeling from last week's stabbing.</p>
        
            <p>Police are asking those who saw anyone heading towards a vehicle carrying a case to contact them on 105, using the reference number P061584274.</p>
        
            <p>Information could also be provided anonymously via Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
