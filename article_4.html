            <p>A man charged with stabbing a woman at a McDonald's restaurant in Auckland has been denied bail.</p>
        
            <p>The 45-year-old was arrested at around 8pm on Thursday after a serious assault at a restaurant on Stoddard Road in Wesley, a central suburb located between Mt Roskill and Mt Eden.</p>
        
            <p>He was charged with intentionally causing grievous bodily harm and two counts of failing to assist police during a computer search.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutors opposed the man's bail application, saying the assault was particularly brutal.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard the victim was undergoing lifesaving surgery.</p>
        
            <p>The accused was remanded in custody to reappear next month.</p>
        
            <p>Police continued their scene examination on Friday and planned to maintain an increased presence in the area.</p>
        
            <p>They noted the victim and the accused were "in a family relationship" and it was believed it to be an isolated incident.</p>
        
            <p>"Police wish to reassure the public that there is not thought to be any ongoing threat to public safety."</p>
        
            <p>At least seven police vehicles were at the scene on Thursday evening, and a large number of police officers were stood outside the restaurant.</p>
