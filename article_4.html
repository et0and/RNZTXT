            <p>Enrolments have increased at Otago University, breaking three years of decline.</p>
        
            <p>The University of Auckland and Auckland University of Technology have also said their enrolments had increased.</p>
        
            <p>Otago said its full-time equivalent enrolments were 469 EFTS or 2.7 percent higher than the same time last year at 18,018.</p>
        
            <p>The university said the increase was its first since 2021 when, according to annual reports, it had about 19,603 EFTS.</p>
        
            <p>Last year Otago forecast a deficit following [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/511835/university-enrolments-drop-at-otago-rise-at-waikato</p>
        
            <p>three years of falling enrolments].</p>
        
            <p>The university said this year's increase included 6.6 percent more first-year domestic students and 26.6 percent more first-year foreign students.</p>
        
            <p>Otago's vice-chancellor Grant Robertson said the result was heartening in financially challenging times.</p>
        
            <p>"This is positive news, not only for 2025, but also beyond that, as the pipeline impact of a return to first-year growth will benefit us into the future," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The University of Auckland said it had 29,123 full-time equivalent students in Feburary, nearly eight percent more than the same time last year.</p>
        
            <p>"Postgraduate enrolments rose from 6,168 to 7,605 EFTS (11,912 to 13,768 students) and there was a 30 percent jump in school leavers from 4,016 to 5,236 EFTS (5,062 to 6,347 students)," it said.  </p>
        
            <p>AUT said it was expecting more students this year, but did not provide figures.</p>
        
            <p>Enrolments at most universities dropped in 2022 and 2023 after spiking in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Since the pandemic began in early 2020, Canterbury and Lincoln have increased their share of domestic enrolments while Victoria and Massey lost ground.</p>
