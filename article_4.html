        <h2>Weather: Warm start to the weekend</h2>
        <p>
Fire-weary Canterbury should get a much-needed respite from high temperatures and gales as a change in the weather arrives, while much of the motu has had a warm start to the weekend, MetService says.

            <p>Fire-weary Canterbury should get a much-needed respite from high temperatures and north-west gales as a change in the weather arrives, while much of the motu has had a warm start to the weekend, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>The Canterbury High Country has been under a strong wind watch through Saturday, but meteorologist David Miller said the northwest gales should ease Saturday evening and night - good news for regional firefighters after a week of wild fires.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Saturday, Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ) warned Cantabrians to take particular care not to spark new wildfires, in the hot and windy weather.</p>
        
            <p>Miller said Christchurch was on track to reach 32C on Saturday, but a change to northeasterly winds would bring respite from the heat on Sunday, with a maximum high of 21C expected.</p>
        
            <p>Much of the country had a warm Saturday, thanks to light northwesterly winds, Miller said: "Much of the country is looking at fairly warm temperatures, across both islands: mid to high 20s, maybe even touching the early 30s in the eastern parts of both islands."</p>
        
            <p>It's been a hot day for most of the North Island and eastern South Island, with northwesterly winds driving temperatures up above 30°C in a few places ♨Christchurch got to 32°C today (31.8°C at the airport) - their highest temperature since January!  pic.twitter.com/6ls8W2YXSt</p>
        
            <p>As well as Christchurch, areas that had a warm day included Tairāwhiti - Gisborne, Timaru, Masterton, Kaikōura, Ashburton and Bleinheim.</p>
        
            <p>"Central Otago is seeing temperatures in the mid-20s [Saturday] and Invercargill is having 19 - that's warm for them," Miller said.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland's warm trend - in the mid-20s - is expected to continue for the next few days, but it was "fairly typical" for this time of year, and no urban alerts were necessary.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hot but not exceedingly so," he said.</p>
        
            <p>MetService will again issue 'urban heat alerts' this summer if a city's temperatures are expected to be "well above average".</p>
