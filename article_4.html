            <p>Jordyn with a Why has taken out the APRA Maioha Award, which recognises contemporary Māori music and songwriters telling Te Ao Māori stories, for her waiata 'He Rei Niho'.</p>
        
            <p>The winners were determined by the votes of New Zealand APRA members (who are also songwriters, producers and performers).</p>
        
            <p>Jazz legend Mike Nock was also inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame. He told RNZ, despite his many awards, this recognition would be top of the list for him.</p>
