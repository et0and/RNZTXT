            <p>Californian pop punk trio Blink-182 finally acknowledged the last-minute cancellation of their Christchurch show during a recent Melbourne concert, by taking a jab at the South Island city.</p>
        
            <p>In a clip circulating on social media, the band's drummer, Travis Barker, mistakenly addressed the Melbourne crowd as Sydney, before bassist Mark Hoppus kept the joke going with a gag about the recently cancelled show.</p>
        
            <p>"To be honest Sydney sucked so f...ing bad, we had to cancel Christchurch," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Guitarist Tom DeLonge responded: "F... Christchurch."</p>
        
            <p>"That's a gnarly name for a town, can you imagine naming your f...ing city that?"</p>
        
            <p>"If I were God," replied Hoppus.</p>

            <p>The New Zealand leg of the reunion tour of the pop punk trio - known for hits such as 'Miss You' and 'All The Small Things' - was first announced in 2022, before being later rescheduled due to fast-selling Australian tickets that saw the band add four more dates to their tour leg across the ditch.</p>
        
            <p>The cancellation of the 4 March Christchurch show was announced in an email to ticket holders in February, citing "unanticipated logistical issues outside of the band's control".</p>
        
            <p>Neither the band or its members had addressed the cancellation on social media since the announcement.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch Blink-182 fan, James O'Caiside who had tickets to the Wolfbrook Arena concert, said he was not surprised by the band's comments.</p>
        
            <p>"To be fair, they've always ripped on anything live. I would happily hear them say, 'F... you Christchurch' in Christchurch."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Andrei Moore, who heads the arts and creative industries portfolio at Christchurch City Council, condemned the comments.</p>
        
            <p>Writing on Facebook, he said: "Disappointing to learn of Blink-182 saying 'f*** Christchurch' on stage in Melbourne after cancelling their sold-out show that many Christchurch folk and visitors bought tickets for 18 months in advance.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been through more than our fair share of challenges over the years which have led to many concert cancellations but I can't ever recall any of them being followed up with an attitude as bad as this one."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the promoter recently told Stuff there would be no further comment or statement, outside of what was emailed to ticket holders.</p>
        
            <p>The band will still play Auckland's Spark Arena on 2 March.</p>
