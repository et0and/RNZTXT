            <p>Staff at Plunket will soon be trained to administer vaccines.</p>
        
            <p>Minister of Health Shane Reti hoped the plan would improve declining immunisation rates and convince vaccine-hesitant parents to give their kids their vaccinations.</p>
        
            <p>The pilot programme announced on Wednesday will set up vaccination services at 27 of Plunket's clinics.</p>
        
            <p>Associate Health Minister Casey Costello said the government would contribute $1 million to the pilot through to June 2026.</p>
        
            <p>"This funding will support Whānau Āwhina Plunket to train its workforce as vaccinators and establish immunisation services," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Reti said the programme was a response to dangerously low immunisation rates.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the past few years childhood immunisation rates have been falling across the world, and New Zealand is no exception," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The latest quarterly results from Health New Zealand show that 76.6 percent of children were immunised at 24 months."</p>
        
            <p>The government's goal was 95 percent.</p>
        
            <p>He said there were several reasons for the decline, including vaccine hesitancy.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a combination of things, and it's not just unique to New Zealand... Across the world immunisation post-Covid has been a struggle, there's been that increase in vaccine hesitancy," Reti said.</p>
        
            <p>"[The solution is] a combination of persuading parents and ongoing education. But it's also access, making it easy to do the right thing. They want to do the right thing, [so] how do we make it easy?"</p>
        
            <p>Plunket chief executive Fiona Kingsford said her staff were uniquely placed to talk families through the immunisation process.</p>
        
            <p>She hoped to convince parents that vaccines were safe and necessary for their babies.</p>
        
            <p>"That's one thing Plunket nurses already do... Talking to families about immunisation," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The wonderful opportunity we have now is we also get the opportunity to offer to do that vaccination there and then for that family."</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand College of General Practitioners medical director Luke Bradford said Plunket's existing relationships with parents would make a big difference.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the biggest things that makes a difference in vaccine hesitancy is having conversations with trusted voices, people who you believe have you and your child's best interests at heart," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's certainly true of Plunket, so hopefully it will help."</p>
        
            <p>He said the new programme would particularly benefit parents who couldn't access a GP.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a significant portion of people who are unenrolled, who are then not vaccinated," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This will give those people an opportunity."</p>
        
            <p>Just 27 out of Plunket's roughly 400 clinics would administer vaccines during the 18-month pilot.</p>
        
            <p>In that time, Kingsford said staff would experiment with different ways to deliver the vaccines.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll be trying immunisations running alongside the Well Child visit, when they come into clinic, as well as independent immunisation clinics, we'll also be trialling it eventually in-home," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Then also through things like community events, where we might run an event on a weekend."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was vital that New Zealand increased its immunisation rates quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"It's so important, we have really low immunisation rates, in particular, things like whooping cough, pertussis, and measles," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We really are on the cusp of significant outbreaks if we don't lift our immunisation rates."</p>
        
            <p>The first Plunket clinic would start delivering vaccines in Whangārei before the end of 2024.</p>
