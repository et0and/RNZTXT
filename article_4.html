            <p>A West Auckland teen has been arrested after three people were injured by a fleeing vehicle last month.</p>
        
            <p>Police say a woman ran to a waiting vehicle in Henderson after allegedly stealing from a supermarket three weeks ago.</p>
        
            <p>The driver tried to flee, but crashed into another vehicle with two people inside.</p>
        
            <p>Police claim the driver stole a handbag from the vehicle he crashed into, before driving off at speed, injuring the two occupants and a third person who was trying to intervene.</p>
        
            <p>Detectives have arrested a 19-year-old Ranui man, charging him with three counts of aggravated assault and one of theft.</p>
        
            <p>A 21-year-old woman has also been summoned to court over the initial shoplifting.</p>
        
            <p>The teen is expected to appear in Waitākere District Court next week.</p>
