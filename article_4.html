            <p>Bird lovers navigated a pandemic and rising living costs to gather priceless data on the country's native birds, an expert says.</p>
        
            <p>After five years, the country's largest citizen science project to map the distribution and abundance of New Zealand birds has been completed.</p>
        
            <p>In that time more than 100 bird species were observed by people contributing to the New Zealand Bird Atlas.</p>
        
            <p>Coordinator Dan Burgin said birdwatchers had endured the Covid-19 pandemic, the lockdowns and the rising cost of living "and still came together and amassed nationally significant data".</p>
        
            <p>You can search the the full atlas here.</p>
        
            <p>"It can't be understated how important this is. It's going to inform bird research on populations for decades to come so we've been blown away."</p>
        
            <p>Participants were invited to upload their bird observations to the website.</p>
        
            <p>Burgin said at least 1700 people helped, 145,000 hours went into the project - the equivalent of 6000 days.</p>
        
            <p>"It was a huge huge and very practical effort and we're just immensely grateful."</p>

            <p>Early on, they were told their information "could light up the country" and held fill in gaps in knowledge.</p>
        
            <p>Grid maps were provided and the co-ordinators would sometimes direct people to certain areas and ask for observations or ask them to watch for a species' activity at night.</p>
        
            <p>The top species spotted were the chaffinch, the Eurasian blackbird, the silvereye and the grey warbler.</p>

            <p>The last bird atlas was completed around 20 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>A lot had changed in that time, Burgin said, so it was vital to have longterm data sets to provide an understanding of what was happening and guide wise conservation decisions.</p>
        
            <p>The project was coordinated by Wildlife Management International Limited on behalf of Birds New Zealand.</p>
