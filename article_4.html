            <p>Consumer NZ has made an online database which will let New Zealanders choose sunscreen brands that are transparent about product testing.</p>
        
            <p>The database has details about the sunscreens' ingredients, SPF, water-resistance claims and their type and price.</p>
        
            <p>More than 90 companies who sell sunscreen in New Zealand were asked for information about when and where their products have been tested.</p>
        
            <p>But this isn't a requirement under the mandatory sunscreen standard.</p>
        
            <p>Consumer NZ research and test writer Belinda Castles said more than 90 percent of people think companies should regularly test their products to ensure claims on the label are true.</p>
        
            <p>"Our independent testing over many years has found companies often rely on tests that are several years old to support claims. We don't think this is good enough for a product that needs to protect us from the sun's harmful UV rays," Castles said.</p>
        
            <p>"Thirty brands came back to us with up-to-date information about their tests, product ingredients and claims. We have compiled this information into our new database, which is free and available to all New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>But not all brands provided details including Nivea, Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic, which would not say when or where their products were tested.</p>
        
            <p>Cosmetics NZ general manager Martha van Arts said a lot of the information around these products was already publicly available.</p>
        
            <p>Since 8 September, all SPF sunscreens in New Zealand must comply with the Sunscreen Act 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The new standards meant all brands were required to to met at least SPF29, with insect repellents also needing to be at at least SPF4 or higher.</p>
        
            <p>Companies were also required to label the SPF clearly with concise instructions on how to apply the product effectively.</p>
        
            <p>It also meant tightening rules around product performance such as making sure there has been thorough, consistent and internationally recognised testing.</p>
        
            <p>Van Arts said Cosmetics NZ has been advocating for the change for a long time.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether a sunscreen is a global brand or independent brand with small distribution, it must be tested for safety and efficacy, specifically with regards to SPF claims.</p>
        
            <p>"Until now, it has been impossible for consumers to know when or where a product was tested. We have designed and created this database to give New Zealanders the information they want and need," she said.</p>
