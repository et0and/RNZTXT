            <p>High Alert - Drug Information and Alerts New Zealand - is warning of a substance being sold as ketamine in the Wellington region.</p>
        
            <p>The substance 2-Fluoro-2-Oxo-PCE, also known as 2F-NENDCK or CanKet, was found in two samples of white powder/crystal being sold as ketamine.</p>
        
            <p>Ketamine is a recreational drug that can send users into a euphoric, out-of-body experience called a k-hole.</p>
        
            <p>2-Fluoro-2-Oxo-PCE is a drug synthesised to be similar to ketamine, and although it is structurally similar, High Alert said it can produce unexpected and unpredictable effects.</p>
        
            <p>High Alert said some reported effects of 2-Fluoro-2-Oxo-PCE include a longer k-hole effect, more intense feelings of intoxication, little to no feelings of euphoria or introspection, strong visual disturbances, greater feelings of disorientation, nausea, and a long duration - up to 4 to 6 hours.</p>
        
            <p>The substance was believed to be widely circulating in the Wellington region, and may possibly be present in other regions.</p>
        
            <p>High Alert recommended that people have their drugs checked to help minimise the risk.</p>
        
            <p>KnowYourStuffNZ, the New Zealand Drug Foundation and the New Zealand Needle Exchange Programme run regular drug checking clinics.</p>
        
            <p>Information on upcoming clinics, including those coming up in the Wellington region, can be found on the New Zealand Drug Foundation's website - The Level.</p>
