            <p>Dozens of police are breathtesting people driving into the Napier suburb of Maraenui on Thursday, as the area prepares for a large gang tangi on Friday and Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The tangi is for Napier's Mongrel Mob Barbarian chapter president, "Heil Dogg", also known as Angus Benson and Angus Ratima.</p>
        
            <p>Police had set up checkpoints in two different locations near the gang's Napier headquarters, and said they were preparing for large numbers of gang members from across the region to visit the area and pay their respects.</p>
        
            <p>At the Maraenui gang pad, a large marquee and food truck had been set up on the front lawn, and catering trucks were seen dropping off supplies.</p>
        
            <p>In a social media post, attendees are being warned of road closures near the family's home and are urged to behave.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone is responsible for their own behavior, carloads, risk management and situations throughout this week...‼️PLAY UPS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED‼️..Said with LOVE," the post reads.</p>
        
            <p>Heil's body was at his mother's home in Maraenui, and will be taken to the nearby gang headquarters on Friday where he will lie for his last night and for poroporoaki (farewell).</p>
        
            <p>A person on social media reflected on previous tangi, and said: "Our Heil wouldve been right in there to like he was with all our whanau when they passed on, tha Man with the biggest heart smiles & Aroha."</p>
        
            <p>The service is being held on Saturday in Marewa.</p>
