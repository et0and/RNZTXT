The grounding of the Aratere ferry is a wake-up call for the coalition government to invest in new vessels and infrastructure, critics say.

            <p>The grounding of the Aratere ferry is a wake-up call for the coalition government to invest in new vessels and infrastructure, critics say.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis cancelled the contract for new ferries after the budget blew out to nearly $3 billion.</p>
        
            <p>"The Interislander has been in dire straits of late with countless cancellations, delays and now a ship stranded," said Green Party transport spokesperson Julie Anne Genter.</p>
        
            <p>"We call on the government to commit to deliver replacement ships for the Cook Strait crossing by the next election. It's time to stop playing the blame game with KiwiRail."</p>
        
            <p>Genter said Willis' "reckless decision" to cancel the contract for new ferries without an alternative plan in place was "disastrous".</p>
        
            <p>"In what has become a hallmark of this coalition government, it has thrown all of its transport eggs into the roading basket, failing to adequately invest in rail and low-carbon, low-cost forms of transport.</p>

Green Party transport spokesperson Julie Anne Genter says the government has to start presenting real solutions.

            <p>She said the government had to present real solutions rather than making excuses.</p>
        
            <p>"The thing is, this government knows all too well that the Interislander ferries aren't fit for long term purpose.</p>
        
            <p>"Yet sadly, while they allow the conditions to fester, a maritime disaster grows more likely."</p>
        
            <p>The Maritime Union says if the steering had failed on the Aratere during bad weather or when it was in the Cook Strait, the outcome could have been disastrous.</p>
        
            <p>Its national secretary Carl Findlay said the government made a massive error cancelling the iRex project.</p>
        
            <p>"The Interislander ferries are at end of life, and there have been repeated incidents, such as the loss of power on the Kaitaki last year.</p>
        
            <p>"If this incident does not shake the government out of its complacency about the need for investment in new vessels and infrastructure, what will it take?"</p>
        
            <p>Findlay said refloating the vessel would be a difficult and complex operation.</p>
        
            <p>The union had been in touch with crew members aboard the Aratere, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Ia Ara Aotearoa Transporting New Zealand said this was the "latest, worrying development" in "longstanding and persistent maintenance issues" of the Interislander fleet.</p>
        
            <p>"This is another example of a major failure of a ferry in just over 18 months, after the Kaitaki lost power off Wellington last year," said its interim CEO Dom Kalasih.</p>
        
            <p>" The road freight sector has demonstrated considerable resilience in dealing with ferry disruptions, but we need to see an enduring solution achieved as soon as possible."</p>
        
            <p>He said these sorts of disruptions should not be happening.</p>
        
            <p>"We need the expert Ministerial Advisory Group tasked with providing independent advice and assurance on the future of KiwiRail's inter-island ferry service to progress with urgency, and then see a swift response from the government and KiwiRail."</p>
