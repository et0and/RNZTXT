            <p>One of the founding members of Maribou State admits working towards the release of their new album helped "keep him sane" as he dealt with health complications.</p>
        
            <p>Following a seven-year absence, the British electronic duo - comprising Chris Davids and Liam Ivory - made a long-awaited return to the fold earlier this year with the release of their third studio album Hallucinating Love.</p>
        
            <p>The pair were one of the drawcard closing acts of the "hangar" stage at last weekend's Electric Avenue festival in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Recording and performing has come to a halt in recent years after Davids started experiencing chronic headaches at the back end of 2021.</p>
        
            <p>A year later he was diagnosed with a rare condition called chiari malformation that causes pressure on the brain.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ, Davids said getting through the recording process had been a purgative experience for him.</p>
        
            <p>"The past few years have been challenging and very difficult," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been cathartic and definitely one of the things that has kept me sane during the past few years.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially at this point now the music has come out, it's made a massive shift."</p>
        
            <p>As the completion of their album drew closer, Davids underwent surgery in November 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Hallucinating Love marks their first full-length offering since 2018's Kingdoms in Colour, a seven-year interval in which time has been accentuated by the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>"It does pose challenges when you do spread stuff out over that period of time," Davids said.</p>
        
            <p>"The first song was written in 2020 and the last was written the end of 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite a big gap and so many different experiences."</p>

            <p>Despite the intermittent nature of production over this time, both Davids and Ivory aimed to "streamline" things when mixing to ensure the final product sounded cohesive.</p>
        
            <p>However, some fans have observed distinctions with certain tracks, whose genesis date back to a simpler time.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a song on the album called 'Eko's', a lot of people have picked up that it sounds quite separate to the rest of the album, because we were in a different time," Davids said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even though the sonic threads are there, you can't change that emotional quality."</p>
        
            <p>Part of the journey of the album was casting the net "far and wide" with collaborators.</p>
        
            <p>Regular accomplices Holly Walker and Jack Sibley's North Downs again feature, but the butterly soul vocals of Gaidaa and Andreya Triana also come on board.</p>
        
            <p>Triana has previously turned heads courtesy of impressive guest appearances with production virtuosos Flying Lotus, Mr Scruff and Bonobo.</p>
        
            <p>"We first heard her on Bonobo's Black Sands album," Ivory said.</p>
        
            <p>"That was a record to us at the time that was super influential, and we've always loved her voice."</p>
        
            <p>The pair have also shown a fondness for some of New Zealand's leading names.</p>
        
            <p>Sharing the bill with Fat Freddy's Drop, a group that continues to boast an esteemed profile in Europe, was one of the main catalysts for Maribou State's eagerness for Electric Avenue.</p>
        
            <p>The Brits also handpicked the track 'Hours' for their 2020 Fabric mix, a slice of jazz-infused breakbeat soul by New Zealand multi-instrumentalist Julien Dyne featuring Ladi6.</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead to the remainder of 2025, Maribou State are all about making up for lost time.</p>
        
            <p>Having completed their journey down under in recent days, the pair are relishing the voyage ahead, involving more festivals and "lots and lots of gigs" across the globe.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just basically touring solidly as much as possible from now until next summer and a little bit beyond that," Ivory said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been out of the market for so long…so we're just going to make the most of it."</p>
