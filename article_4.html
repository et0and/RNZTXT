            <p>Blenheim Gymnastics Club says it is shocked to learn of serious sexual offending against by one of its former coaches.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, Gregory Pask pleaded guilty at Blenheim District Court to 29 charges of sexual offending against several girls and producing objectionable material between 2014 and September this year.</p>
        
            <p>Marlborough CIB Detective Sergeant Ash Clarke said police believed there could be further victims.</p>
        
            <p>The club issued a statement on its website, saying it was appalled to learn of offending by Pask, who had a position of trust in the community.</p>
        
            <p>It was aware of the legal proceedings, but had been unable to comment due to suppression orders which prevented details being made public before Pask entered guilty pleas on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The club said its primary concern was the well-being of the victims and had reassured members that it was a safe place.</p>
        
            <p>Gymnastics New Zealand chief executive Andrea Nelson said the organisation was also ensuring the victims of Pask's sexual offending were receiving the support they needed.</p>
        
            <p>The offending was a "horrible reminder" that all sport and recreational activities where children were supervised by adults were vulnerable to child safeguarding issues, Nelson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It can happen anywhere - and all people who work or volunteer in the sector need to be vigilant and alert to these threats."</p>
        
            <p>The organisation was closely monitoring the situation, with the wellbeing of the victims its main concern, Nelson said.</p>
        
            <p>It would continue to monitor developments in the case and take any actions required to support the safety and wellbeing of its participants and members.</p>
