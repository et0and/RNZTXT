            <p>The owner of a Queenstown laundromat has been ordered to pay a former employee - and best friend - almost $60,000 after the Employment Relations Authority found the worker was unjustifiably dismissed, and was the subject of a "unilateral breach of her employment agreement".</p>
        
            <p>Employment Relations Authority (ERA) member David Beck ordered Queenstown Local Laundry Services' (QL) sole director and shareholder Jody King to fork out $25,000 to Vanessa Chandler in wage arrears, $20,000 compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings, and $13,345 in lost wages.</p>
        
            <p>Beck's decision says the pair used to be close friends, with Chandler living at King's home for 10 years before initially working for QL as a laundress for two years from 2016, then returning as laundry supervisor in August 2019.</p>
        
            <p>She was to work 41 hours, Monday to Friday, at $25 an hour, but after a small pay rise it decreased to $585.50 a week from 25 May, 2020, after the first Covid lockdown.</p>
        
            <p>Chandler says after telling King that was unsustainable, they agreed to reduce her hours accordingly, to three days a week.</p>
        
            <p>She expected that to continue for only six weeks, but her hours weren't restored and their relationship began to deteriorate to the point where they stopped communicating.</p>
        
            <p>Chandler didn't formally challenge the hours reduction at the time, nor was it documented as an agreed variation by QL.</p>
        
            <p>King tried to resolve matters in a letter to Chandler in July 2021, but Beck described it as an "amalgam of personal and work-related comment".</p>
        
            <p>"Despite offering an apology for the impact of her behaviour ... the letter is peppered with negative and pejorative comment on Ms Chandler's approach to her work."</p>
        
            <p>Two comments from King stood out to Beck.</p>
        
            <p>The first: "I need all my staff to be supportive and proactive to my instructions. As there will be big changes happening."</p>
        
            <p>The second: "As a boss, if this is not addressed by Thursday 19th August - Regretfully I will be forced you down without pay until you meet to discuss work related matters (sic)."</p>
        
            <p>King also invited Chandler to attend an "urgent meeting" with a third person, or to inform her in writing of what the issues were so they could be addressed.</p>
        
            <p>That letter and later correspondence showed an ongoing issue of QL being unable to persuade Chandler to fill out daily timesheets.</p>
        
            <p>Chandler responded by text on 9 August seeking clarity on work-related mistakes to rectify, but got no coherent response so arranged a meeting, mediated by a Queenstown Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) employee.</p>
        
            <p>While Chandler says the meeting was largely inconclusive, King says her employee signalled an intention to resign, but at some future unspecified date.</p>
        
            <p>King also recalled saying there wasn't enough work for all her employees because of the impact of the border closures.</p>
        
            <p>On 28 September, she texted Chandler: "In light of last weeks meeting. Shall we make it two weeks notice from today. (sic)."</p>
        
            <p>Chandler responded: "No I will let you know when."</p>
        
            <p>King: "Ummm. No. that won't work sorry, I can't afford to keep you on. I will write out a formal letter then."</p>
        
            <p>And then: "You made it clear you did not want to work for me. So, that actually works out well."</p>
        
            <p>Chandler says King did not provide her a letter of termination - thereafter, until March 2022, they only communicated via texts that Beck says "were not amicable".</p>
        
            <p>They included an exchange on 27 October where King messaged Chandler: "You said you were leaving at the meeting. Please do so."</p>
        
            <p>On 4 March, 2022, Chandler obtained a medical certificate, leading to a dispute with King over her sick leave allocation.</p>
        
            <p>King sent a text message on 8 March which ended with: "Your actions currently are not 'in good faith' I will not be paying anymore sick days after this week. And your last day of employment with the laundry will be 21st March (sic)."</p>
        
            <p>Chandler didn't return, but was paid in lieu of a two-week notice period.</p>
        
            <p>Chandler raised a personal grievance on 7 June, 2022, claiming she'd been unjustifiably dismissed and was due unspecified wage arrears.</p>
        
            <p>QL's response, authored by King on 9 July, suggested Chandler resigned without any pressure from QL and King didn't have time "to engage in defending such blatant untruths".</p>
        
            <p>However, the ERA found in Chandler's favour.</p>
        
            <p>Beck found no fair process was enacted prior to Chandler's dismissal, in breach of the employment agreement and statutory requirements.</p>
        
            <p>"Overall, I find ... QL did not act in a fair and reasonable manner in all the circumstances and Ms Chandler was treated shabbily - the dismissal and/or redundancy process was enacted in a flawed manner and caused significant detriment."</p>
