            <p>The fire which burned through about 30 hectares near Burnham in Canterbury today is linked to a tyre blowing out on a vehicle, an initial investigation suggests.</p>
        
            <p>Several fire crews using tankers, fire trucks and two helicopters with monsoon buckets have been working through the afternoon to control the flames.</p>
        
            <p>Residents from three homes who were evacuated have been able to return to their houses. A shed was destroyed.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews supported by two helicopters will be patrolling the area overnight to dampen any flare ups. Five helicopters, 22 trucks, tankers and support vehicles were working on the blaze at its peak.</p>

            <p>It was mostly contained by 5pm.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency says the cause of the blaze will not be confirmed until an investigation is completed.</p>
        
            <p>The fire resulted in the closure of State Highway 1 during the afternoon and early evening, resulting in large queues of traffic.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews were first called to SH1 near the intersection of Telegraph Road about 1.30pm to reports of three grass fires.</p>
        
            <p>Burnham resident Colleen said she came home from work early after hearing about the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"It's crazy right? We've had so many fires already at the start of Summer.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been really hot and dry which has caused the fires."</p>
