            <p>Airports will be chock-a-block all Easter weekend, with hundreds of thousands of travellers taking to the sky.</p>
        
            <p>Thursday is the busiest day for Air New Zealand, with nearly 55,000 passengers booked on flights.</p>
        
            <p>All up, 227,000 travellers will travel with the airline this long weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Domestic general manager Iain Walker told Checkpoint Thursday had been a "very busy day", with "a lot of people hopping around the country".</p>
        
            <p>There had been some "weather challenges", particularly in windy Wellington, but the airline was working hard to get everyone where they needed to go, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Out of 550 flights, 15 had been cancelled - mostly due to weather, but one aircraft was out of action after a bird strike on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Affected customers were being offered later flights, Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>"Pretty much everyone will be able to fly today."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone flying over the weekend was asked to get to the airport a little earlier than normal to allow time to get through security.</p>
        
            <p>No major queues had been reported, but it was best for people's peace of mind to allow extra time - especially for those travelling with children, Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>"It just takes away that panic."</p>
        
            <p>School holidays begin on 13 April and Walker said 800,000 passengers would be catching Air New Zealand flights.</p>
        
            <p>That figure included 4000 unaccompanied minors.</p>
        
            <p>The number one destination for the school holidays was Queenstown, which was "very popular", he said.</p>
