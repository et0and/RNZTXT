            <p>Police are investigating several serious incidents involving youth offenders in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>The first alleged incident occurred outside of a gym in Wigram before 6pm on Tuesday, where a vehicle was stolen, before four young people threatened to take another person's car outside a store in Hornby.</p>
        
            <p>Another incident occurred before 10pm, when a 17-year-old was targeted as he stepped off a bus on Mackworth Street in Woolston, police said.</p>
        
            <p>A vehicle he described as Toyota Aqua attempted to run him over, before one of the offenders got out of the vehicle and tried to steal his cell phone.</p>
        
            <p>Just 45 minutes later on Skyhawk Road in Wigram, a group of young people allegedly threatened another person, before taking their phone and their dog, which has since been located.</p>
        
            <p>A vape store on Stanmore Road was then targeted at 4.36am, after offenders smashed their way in, police said.</p>
        
            <p>The offenders fled as soon as police arrived, and in such a dangerous manner, a pursuit was not possible.</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury metro area commander Superintendent Lane Todd said early inquiries led police to believe all offences were related.</p>
        
            <p>"We now have a number of officers working to identify and locate the people involved," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"This type of behaviour is completely unacceptable, and we will ensure they are held accountable for their dangerous and reckless actions which has left a number of victims extremely shaken.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be ensuring they receive Victim Support alongside ongoing police support."</p>
        
            <p>Forensic examinations are underway at the scenes and of vehicles located.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information can contact police online or call 105 using reference number P060294419.</p>
