            <p>Residents and business owners on Auckland's Waiheke Island are split on what to make of the island's housing crisis.</p>
        
            <p>Some believe the island is suffering from "overtourism," as landlords push long-term tenants out and converted their rental properties into vacation rentals. But others say the lack of housing is just another symptom of a nationwide crisis.</p>
        
            <p>The island hosts more than 900,000 visitors each year, many staying in short term rentals listed on services like Airbnb.</p>
        
            <p>Trade Me Property listings show just over a dozen long-term rentals on Waiheke Island, but short-term listings on Airbnb number in the hundreds.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a characterisation of Waiheke being helicopters and vineyards," Waiheke Community Housing Trust spokesperson Damian Sycamore said.</p>
        
            <p>"But there's a community here being disembowelled by rampant overtourism."</p>
        
            <p>Sycamore is among a number of Waiheke residents calling for the government to regulate short-stay rentals.</p>
        
            <p>He said long-term renters were being muscled out of the market.</p>
        
            <p>"Waiheke's properties have been massively financialised, it's possible now for a short-term rental to be 250 percent more profitable than a long-term rental.</p>
        
            <p>"That makes it heavily imbalanced in terms of what people that own properties on Waiheke do [with their properties]."</p>
        
            <p>EcoZip Adventures managing director Gavin Oliver said the crisis was not unique to Waiheke.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd certainly say it's an issue but it's not a Waiheke-specific issue, it's a national issue, and we need a national solution to this problem.</p>
        
            <p>"In places like Queenstown and Wanaka it's just as acute, Wellington is as bad, and listening to reports coming in from other parts of the country they too have this problem."</p>
        
            <p>Sycamore disagreed.</p>
        
            <p>"Waiheke probably has the most acute housing crisis of anywhere in New Zealand, which is seriously saying something.</p>
        
            <p>"According to Infometrics, the rent to income ratio is even worse on Waiheke than it is in the Queenstown-Lakes district."</p>
        
            <p>Waiheke Local Board member Paul Walden said the lack of long term rentals was damaging his community.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite heartbreaking, we've had a beautiful young family who has lived next door for a number of years, and they've lost their rental accommodation so they go to another house, then another house... There's no long-term confidence they will find adequate rental accommodation [on Waiheke]."</p>

Some residents have resorted to staying in sheds on Waiheke Island.

            <p>Walden said some residents had resorted to staying in sheds.</p>
        
            <p>"We have... Just about a subculture, really, of people that are making do across the island living in poor quality housing under the radar.</p>
        
            <p>"Garden sheds and sleepouts and garages that have been converted to provide accommodation."</p>
        
            <p>The owner of vineyard Casita Miro, Dr Barnett Bond, said a lot of the houses on Waiheke were empty.</p>
        
            <p>"Because it's a holiday destination, lots of Aucklanders have bought holiday homes here and many of those Aucklanders choose to leave those homes empty.</p>
        
            <p>"That's not a good thing if you're trying to house a resident population who don't own their own homes, renters."</p>
        
            <p>But he did not think it was tourists' fault.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not the tourists that caused the property crisis, it's the speculating on property by people who then leave those buildings empty... That's the problem.</p>
        
            <p>"Most tourists who come to Waiheke don't stay overnight."</p>
        
            <p>TƒÅtaki Auckland Unlimited's Head of Tourism, Karen Thompson-Smith, said housing on Waiheke Island was indeed an issue but tourism was not to blame.</p>
        
            <p>"We've only reached 80 percent pre-Covid [tourism] numbers, so I don't believe we're seeing overtourism as perhaps you would see in places like Barcelona," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"In fact when I was talking to a number of operators based on Waiheke... It's probably one of the quietest winters they've ever had."</p>
        
            <p>Gavin Oliver noted that New York had grappled with a similar issue.</p>
        
            <p>"We certainly need to try and find a solution, the New York model is that you're only able to rent your property out if you're actually resident in the property... That's certainly one solution.</p>
        
            <p>"It's certainly a really interesting model, it's one of the ones that's touted quite widely and I'd be keen to see how that could be applied."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council has agreed to meet with the Waiheke community in October.</p>
