            <p>North Dunedin students have been busy with bags and bin, cleaning up their neighbourhood in memory of Sophia Crestani.</p>
        
            <p>It has been five years since the 19-year-old University of Otago student died at an overcrowded Dunedin party in October, 2019.</p>
        
            <p>This week, a coroner found her death was a tragic, but likely preventable accident.</p>
        
            <p>Organisers said the clean up was a chance to connect with their community and tidy their neighbourhood while honouring Sophia Crestani.</p>

            <p>Student Rico Fisher was dragging a massive sack of rubbish down the road with his housemate.</p>
        
            <p>It was their fifth bin run of the day.</p>
        
            <p>"I live in a flat with six boys so as you can imagine, it gets pretty messy. I think this initiative under Sophia's name is just a good way for people to come together and tidy up the street," Fisher said.</p>
        
            <p>People were being more mindful and responsible with flat parties in the wake of her death, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it should have had to come down to that for that shift to happen and it's pretty sad that it did. But I'm glad to see a shift happening now."</p>
        
            <p>Student Oliver Ross was also pitching in with his housemates.</p>
        
            <p>"Keep the landlord happy, don't have to pay extra, clean up the backyard, also a good cause so we love it," Ross said.</p>
        
            <p>Student Max Boennic said there were still a lot of big flat parties.</p>
        
            <p>"But I feel like people are definitely more aware of the danger and the risks that are posed by having big gatherings," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean I saw some things about the student's association trying to set up some bars recently, which would be awesome for the culture."</p>
        
            <p>Charlie Weaver would like to see more student bars so they could have fun in a safer environment.</p>
        
            <p>"It gets people out, they can manage how they drink more because it costs to buy a drink instead of you just buy a box and you just go crazy."</p>
        
            <p>Hold On To Your Friends organises the biannual event, offering clean up gear and kai to people getting involved.</p>
        
            <p>Co-founder Louisa Mason has been blown away by the response.</p>
        
            <p>"The narrative around Dunedin students is so often that we don't care, we just smash glass and we're just these terrible teens that trash their environment.</p>
        
            <p>"But there is actually a very warm undercurrent of people who are like, 'No, this isn't ok. I want to make change, I want to see the change', and they want to be part of the change so it is very heartening to see people showing up."</p>
        
            <p>It has been incredible to see students showing up for Sophia even if they did not know her, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"You've just got to give people the opportunity to do it. If we don't give people the opportunity to care about the environment, then they're not going to care about. But if we provide that space then I think we can get more and more people on the bandwagon."</p>
        
            <p>Olivia Eady and her housemates were clearing out the rubbish from their end-of-year party last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>There was a lot of messaging about being safe while partying, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think everyone's really, really into it as well. I think it creates quite a sense of community, especially on Castle and Leith street, we're so infamous for having these parties ... but definitely everyone's very aware."</p>
        
            <p>There had been lots of letters from the university outlining the consequences for irresponsible or dangerous behaviour, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Things can really quickly get out of hand, especially for young people and alcohol and drugs and things like that.</p>
        
            <p>"But I would like to see a good balance between being safe and still being able to have fun and still keeping the Castle Street culture alive, but without hurting anyone or without any damage."</p>
        
            <p>The rubbish was all being taken to a massive skip and bins located at the university's Marsh Study Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Waste Management waste minimisation co-ordinator Ashley King helped to look after the university's waste, and was helping students with their rubbish.</p>
        
            <p>The response had been awesome, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a conversation brewing in the community and, while what has happened is absolutely devastating, I am excited to see something productive some out of this so we can avoid having that happen again."</p>
        
            <p>The Sophia Charter was created in the wake of her death to enhance safety and well-being of students living in North Dunedin with multiple agencies pledging their support.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, the University of Otago reconfirmed its commitment to the charter.</p>
        
            <p>Louisa Mason was keen to make sure that the university and other agencies that had voiced their commitment to improving student safety and culture were turning their words into action.</p>
