        <h2>Fresh looks for Wellington playgrounds</h2>
        <p>
The Frank Kitts Park playground has been closed since 2021 when a child reportedly broke their leg on the slide.

            <p>Wellington Frank Kitts playground will finally reopen next week after being out of action for almost three years.</p>
        
            <p>The playground was dismantled in September 2021 when the slide was deemed a safety concern after a child reportedly broke their leg.</p>

            <p>There will be an official dawn blessing of the playground - which features a new, interactive waka - on 29 February.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau said she was thrilled the community could enjoy the space once again and thanked the public for their patience.</p>
        
            <p>"After entertaining Wellingtonians and visitors for many years, the playground at Frank Kitts Park was originally scheduled to be redeveloped into a destination playspace in 2016. After delays due to several factors - including the liquidation of the original contractor, rising inflation and other cost pressures - the project was restarted in 2023 with a more modest design," said Whanau.</p>
        
            <p>The area had been designed with a maritime and coastal landscape theme and included a new lighthouse with a refurbished original cupola dome, climbing nets, swing sets and a shaded seating area.</p>
        
            <p>Matthew McIntyre-Wilson was the creator behind the waka - named Whetū Mārama, meaning Bright Star.</p>
        
            <p>He said the waka was more than just a playground feature.</p>
        
            <p>"Whetū Mārama is a living, breathing entity that holds and imparts knowledge. It represents the continuation of our voyaging heritage, a physical and symbolic link to our tūpuna. It is a reminder of the importance of waka in our history - not just as vessels of transport, but as keepers of stories, technology, and traditions."</p>

            <p>The council had also refreshed the playground at Wellington Botanic Garden, which had a new flying fox, a large tower, three long slides and an all-ages swing set.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said after 22 years, the play area was due for a well-deserved upgrade.</p>
        
            <p>There will be an official opening of the botanic garden playground on 1 March along with whānau-friendly activities such as giant bubbles and chalk art.</p>
        
            <p>Both openings are being celebrated with the council-run event Te Rā o Ngā Tamariki - Childrens' Day on Sunday 3 March, when the cable car will be free for those aged between five and 15.</p>
