        <h2>'Dr Polkinghorne was changing' - Friend says surgeon was 'bit more manic' before wife's death</h2>
        <p>
"His nature changed, his physical presence changed ... a little bit irrational, I felt, at times," Stephen MacIntyre, who knew the couple 25 years, has told the court.

            <p>Warning: This story contains discussion of a potential suicide.</p>
        
            <p>A close friend of the retired Auckland eye surgeon accused of murdering his wife, said his friend's behaviour changed in the year leading up to his wife's death.</p>
        
            <p>It's the second week of the trial of Philip Polkinghorne, who denies killing Pauline Hanna in their Remuera home in April 2021. His defence argues she had struggled with her mental health and that her death was a case of suicide.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown's case was that the couple were unhappy, that Polkinghorne was a "heavy" meth user who was living a secret "double life" with a prostitute and that finances had become a strain because of this - and that the combination of these factors led him to kill Hanna during a violent struggle which he then staged as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Stephen MacIntyre, who had known the couple for 25 years is the first personal contact of the couple to testify in the trial at the High Court in Auckland, and appeared through audio-visual link.</p>
        
            <p>He said he came to know Polkinghorne through spending time together at Rings Beach in the Coromandel where they both owned baches - having coffee , fishing, diving and having dinner barbeques together on public holidays and at Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>When asked by Crown Prosecutor Brian Dickey whether there had been any changes he observed of the couple or in his relationship with them in the years previous to Hanna's death, MacIntyre said yes.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt that Dr Polkinghorne was changing…over a period of time, some things I saw and felt I didn't particularly liked, I probably just backed off the relationship a little bit," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I felt that in that period leading up to Pauline's death, he was quite changed, he told me some things that turned out … I doubted the truth of them, his nature changed, his physical presence changed, he became slimmer and more muscly, a different physique, a bit more manic, a little bit irrational I felt, at times," he said.</p>
        
            <p>MacIntyre recalled a time when Polkinghorne told him about an incident in Manaia where he crashed his ute into a fence.</p>
        
            <p>He said Polkinghorne initially said that no one saw the incident and that he got a new ute, but in a later account said he had crashed due to falling asleep at the wheel and was asked to pay for damages.</p>
        
            <p>MacIntyre said his friend's account was inconsistent, and he didn't know if he could believe either of those accounts.</p>
        
            <p>When asked by Dickey what he thought led to that change, MacIntyre said " I felt he was using drugs".</p>
        
            <p>MacIntyre said whereas in the past he would see the couple often on public holidays and Christmas, he saw them less in the year prior to Hanna's death.</p>
        
            <p>He said he observed less change in Hanna, "Pauline didn't change to me other than one thing, I saw her walking one day around the coast, probably in the year before she died and I thought she seemed to have lost a bit of weight, other than that I didn't notice any difference in Pauline".</p>
