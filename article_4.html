            <p>Wellington's newest councillor says the council must find a balance between the current crisis with the city's water pipes and looming future problems.</p>
        
            <p>Green candidate Geordie Rogers won the Wellington City Council by-election for the PukehÄ«nau/Lambton ward by 45 votes after provisional results had the seat going to local businessman Karl Tiefenbacher.</p>
        
            <p>Tiefenbacher was considering applying for a recount.</p>
        
            <p>Rogers told Morning Report  he was confident in his majority and that he would be sworn in on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's woeful water infrastructure has been the subject of much debate recently.</p>
        
            <p>"I think certainly discussions around how we invest in infrastructure has had some influence on the voting. What I do know is that we're continuing to invest massive amounts into our water infrastructure and we're also doing it in a way where we're not trading off the current crisis for future crises," Rogers said.</p>
        
            <p>"People did still want progress on housing, public transport and responding to the climate crisis. But they wanted both the future thinking and the immediate action and I think as a council we have to be thinking about how we deliver that immediate action as well."</p>
        
            <p>He said the council was "finding that balance at the moment".</p>
        
            <p>Rogers said "very few people" turned out to the polls - turnout was just 25 percent of enrolled voters - and so not too much should be read into the narrow margin.</p>
        
            <p>Despite recent tensions around the council table, he said he was looking forward to working with everyone.</p>
