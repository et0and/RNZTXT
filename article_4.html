        <h2>Jury hears climate change defence for Restore Passenger Rail protestors</h2>
        <p>
A jury has heard that New Zealand's major cities could be underwater by the end of this century during the trial of climate activists who hung banners over Wellington's State Highways.

            <p>A jury has heard that New Zealand's major cities could be underwater by the end of this century if carbon emissions aren't brought under control.</p>
        
            <p>Four members of the Restore Passenger Rail group are on trial in Wellington District Court for protests against climate change in October 2022.</p>

            <p>The prosecution argued the protesters created unreasonable risk for the people around them when hanging banners above Wellington's State Highways.</p>

            <p>Michael Apathy, Thomas Taptiklis, Te Wehi RƒÅtana and Andrew Sutherland have pleaded not guilty to charges of endangering transport.</p>
        
            <p>In defence-led evidence, climate expert and Victoria University professor James Renwick told the jury that if carbon emissions continued on the current trajectory, the consequences would be devastating.</p>

            <p>He said in the worst-case scenario, sea level rise could be three to four metres, which would endanger even four-storey buildings.</p>
        
            <p>"You could probably swim out the window of this room. Most of downtown Wellington will be underwater, downtown Auckland - most of it will be underwater.</p>
        
            <p>"There's an awful lot of real estate and a lot of people who live within a metre or two of the current sea level."</p>
        
            <p>Renwick said New Zealand had signed up to the 2015 Paris Agreement - an international treaty to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels - which required countries to do as much as they possibly could to limit carbon emissions, however, there was no way to enforce it.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, there was no evidence to suggest carbon emissions would flatline, and it was likely they would increase, he said.</p>
        
            <p>If that happened, he said the world was expected to warm by 5C above pre-industrial levels this century, "which would be catastrophic".</p>
        
            <p>Citing the devastation of Cyclone Gabrielle, Renwick said our country, like other parts of the world, was already experiencing the effects of climate change.</p>
        
            <p>He said the transport industry was New Zealand's fastest-growing producer of carbon dioxide, which meant it should be a target for reducing emissions.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to get people out of cars," said Renwick.</p>
        
            <p>"The Climate Change Commission recommends major investment in public transport, buses and light rail in cities, but also a national rail network - beefing that up so that we can get trucks off the road and put freight onto trains instead."</p>
        
            <p>Neither Renwick nor climate scientist professor Kevin Anderson from Manchester University were cross-examined by the prosecution.</p>
        
            <p>The jury will begin deliberations on Wednesday after closing arguments.</p>
