            <p>Wet and cold weather for much of the country on Monday following the heavy humidity.</p>
        
            <p>Metservice meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane told Morning Report it had been a humid few days in the north of the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Parts of Northland and Auckland hadn't dropped below 20degC even overnight, she said.</p>
        
            <p>There were heavy rain watches in place for Northland, Auckland, Coromandel and Bay of Plenty with possible thunderstorms forecast Monday.</p>
        
            <p>There was also significant rain in the west of the South Island, with the Grey District under heavy rain watch.</p>
        
            <p>Flooding closed State Highway 6 between Barrytown and Punakaiki on the South Island's West Coast.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi was advising all drivers to avoid the area, or delay their journey if possible.</p>
        
            <p>Makgabutlane said that weather system would be heading towards Buller during the day.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the West Coast there were lots of thunderstorms overnight, I see Hokitika had quite a lot of rain over the last 12 hours, over 80mm of rain."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile on the eastern side of the South Island, another weather system was bringing cold temperatures and perhaps some rain.</p>
        
            <p>"Out towards Canterbury, Otago, we're expecting quite a dip in temperatures this afternoon."</p>
        
            <p>That weather system would move up to Wellington later in the day.</p>
        
            <p>"It could be quite a gusty one for us later this evening," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Makgabutlane said it was still a bit early to get a reliable forecast for Christmas Day next week.</p>
        
            <p>"As the time comes closer we will get a much clearer picture for specific parts of the country."</p>
        
            <p>But forecasting was suggesting at least some places would have settled weather for the big day, she said.</p>
