            <p>The death of a man in his Nelson home is still being treated as "unexplained" by police.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said on Tuesday an investigation into the circumstances of the death of 55-year-old Darren James Cook was ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>Cook was found dead in his Suffolk Rd home in Stoke last Friday night after police visited the house for an unrelated matter, Detective Inspector Geoff Baber said.</p>
        
            <p>It was not known who Cook died.</p>
        
            <p>A post-mortem examination was completed on Monday, but Baber said his cause of death was yet to be confirmed and further forensic testing was being done.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were working to piece together what occurred to Cook, prior to his death, Baber said.</p>
