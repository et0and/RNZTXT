        <h2>Rubbish removal a priority in Mangawhai after tornado</h2>
        <p>
The council is promising more than one sweep as residents and businesses dispose of their damaged goods.
</p>
        
            <p>The clean up is continuing in Mangawhai with the council beginning to clear rubbish from the berms of the most affected areas.</p>
        
            <p>Sunday's tornado left a trail of destruction in its wake.</p>
        
            <p>Kaipara District Council chief executive Jason Marris said many residents had already begun shifting rubbish to berms and the council would begin picking up hard commercial waste from the most affected areas on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>Marris said the council would organise more than one sweep and there would also be a collection of green waste in the coming days.</p>
        
            <p>Kaipara Civil Defence Emergency Management local duty controller Jack Rudolph said residents were also being encouraged to get in contact with their insurance providers as some policies also provided an avenue for rubbish removal.</p>
        
            <p>Power has been restored to most of the Northland township, with Northpower restoring all but five connections to its network on Monday night.</p>

            <p>On Monday night connections were being tested and made live to ensure they were safe, with any remaining connections expected to be tested on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"The plan for today is to focus on getting the five remaining customers back on as soon as we can," Northpower chief operating officer Michael Gibbs said.</p>
        
            <p>That would involve replacing a shattered service pole and replacing a line which runs across Old Waipu Road.</p>
        
            <p>A broken transformer, however, would no longer need to be replaced as Northpower had managed to restore it and return it to service.</p>
        
            <p>Gibbs said they expected all remaining properties to have power restored by 3pm on Tuesday except for those that were not safe.</p>
        
            <p>Nine properties in Mangawhai have been yellow stickered and 26 white stickered, a total of 35 properties.</p>
        
            <p>Cordons have been lifted and roads opened, although a part of Old Waipu Road remains under traffic management.</p>
