            <p>Taupō police say they will be highly visible, conducting reassurance patrols, door-knocking and executing search warrants on Friday as they continue to search for a wanted man.</p>
        
            <p>The man is a "person of interest" in an incident in the suburb of Hilltop on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The official police callouts database shows the incident was initially logged as 'firearms offending', on Kōtare Street, and officers attended at 1.40pm.</p>
        
            <p>Five schools and a kindergarten nearby were placed in lockdown, and were only released about 5pm when the police found there was no risk to the wider community and shrunk the cordon.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō area commander Phil Edwards said the man knew who he was and needed to hand himself in.</p>
        
            <p>The affected schools were expected to be open on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"The community is going to see police out and about and we'll be visiting schools to provide that reassurance and thank the kids for being brave and listening to instructions during what was a pretty unsettling time for them," Edwards said.</p>
        
            <p>Tauhara College was among those placed into lockdown on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Principal Ben Hancock said most students did "extremely well".</p>
        
            <p>One local whose property was inside the cordon said police told them to lock themselves indoors as the incident unfolded.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information about the wanted man was asked to contact police.</p>
