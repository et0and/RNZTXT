            <p>Police investigating the death of a person found in a car on fire in Hastings have launched a homicide inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>The body was found after the fire on Irongate Road West in Longlands, Hastings on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Two days later, police said they were treating the death as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Marty James said police were following "strong lines of inquiry".</p>
        
            <p>"We are continuing to piece together what happened and it is only a matter of time before we identify and locate those involved."</p>
        
            <p>He could not give details about the person or the cause of death, only saying a formal identification process was still ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>"This is tragic for whƒÅnau and our Flaxmere community," Hastings Mayor Sandra Hazlehurst said in a statement. "Now we need to leave police to get on with their work."</p>
        
            <p>There was a large team of investigators working on the case.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are today conducting a forensic examination on the vehicle located which has been removed from the original scene.</p>
        
            <p>"Police continue to review CCTV footage, conduct forensic examinations, and further enquiries," he said.</p>
        
            <p>There was no ongoing risk to the public.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information or CCTV footage was asked to contact police and "not take it into your own hands".</p>
        
            <p>"This was an abhorrent act and we are determined to hold those responsible to account," James said.</p>
