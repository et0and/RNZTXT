            <p>The inquiry into this year's big storms has given its interim findings to the government.</p>
        
            <p>The official inquiry has been working since July looking at Cyclone Gabrielle in February and the Auckland Anniversary Day floods in January.</p>
        
            <p>It has now reported to Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery Mark Mitchell, though he will not be releasing the recommendations publicly.</p>
        
            <p>"As these are early insights, the interim recommendations will not be made public," his spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry has put restrictions on releasing them, as "justice and fact-checking processes have not yet been completed", ahead of its final report-back due in March.</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry has conducted 170 interviews and received 145 written submissions.</p>
