            <p>A person has been taken into custody after threatening staff with a gun at a shop in South Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Police had made enquiries to find the man in Papakura before a person matching the description was sighted back at the same premises on Wood Street around two hours later.</p>
        
            <p>The man was found and taken into custody just after 5.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>A Foodstuffs spokesperson said the offender was apprehended at New World Papakura but they believed the incident may have taken place at a nearby business.</p>
        
            <p>No staff or member of the public at New World Papakura was threatened, they said.</p>
        
            <p>The supermarket was evacuated for about 20 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Police remain on Wood Street and the surrounding areas.</p>
        
            <p>They say there is no ongoing risk to the public.</p>
