            <p>A man has been charged with murder in relation to a homicide in Mangamuka in the Far North on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services, including police, were called to a property on Iwitaua Road, Mangamuka at about 9pm after reports of a person being stabbed at the address. The victim, a male, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A 50-year-old man was arrested nearby, and will face a charge of murder.</p>
        
            <p>"We know this will have been a shock to the community, however we would like to reassure people that this appears to be an isolated incident," Northland CIB detective inspector Al Symonds said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a tragic situation and we are ensuring there is support in place for those closest to the victim."</p>
        
            <p>Scene guards remained at the scene on Monday afternoon. A post-mortem was due for that afternoon too.</p>
        
            <p>"While an arrest has been made, there are still a number of enquiries yet to be completed," Symonds said.</p>
        
            <p>The man was due to appear in Kaikohe District Court on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Police would like to hear from anyone with information about the incident - call 106 or go online and quote file number 240304/6284, or call Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
