            <p>The Automobile Association believes quieter roads across the country on Christmas Eve, is due to Christmas being mid-week in 2024.</p>
        
            <p>It is reminding motorists to drive to the conditions, not take any risks and expect delays over the holiday period, as people begin to head away.</p>
        
            <p>Principal advisor Terry Collins said traffic has been spread out this year.</p>
        
            <p>"We know in our office we shut down on Friday as opposed to working up to new Christmas Eve.</p>
        
            <p>"So what we tend to see on those circumstances where Christmas Day is kind of mid-week or whatever people shut down or leave early and so traffic is spread over more days and we get this congestion as a result."</p>
        
            <p>According to the Transport Agency, the most congestion was on State Highway One on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>"Regarding holiday traffic congestion, there were 30-45 minute delays on SH1 between ÅŒtaki and Ohau yesterday (Monday) for northbound traffic from about 11.30am to 3.30pm. On Sunday, there were 25 minute delays for traffic on SH1 between Hamilton and Tirau from 11.30am, but this was resolved by 3.30pm."</p>
        
            <p>Collins wanted people to make smart choices when out on the roads.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if people may have travelled already and those that are about to travel is to consider that road toll drive safely.</p>
        
            <p>"There's still going to be some delays I imagine, don't be frustrated, expect them. Travel at a safe speed and leave plenty of room in anticipate that traffic and make that journey more worth while.</p>
        
            <p>"We are on track if we have a good holiday period to have our lowest road toll in a decade and if we consider our population basis, it will be the lowest road toll in 100 years.</p>
        
            <p>"So I think if we've got low congestion right now and people are spreading out that traffic and I haven't seen any accidents in the last day or so then we could be on track for a record-breaking low road toll.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had a couple of bad ones in the last two years, really like to see an improvement this year," Collins said.</p>
        
            <p>The official holiday road toll begins at 4pm on Christmas Eve and ends at 6am on 5 January.</p>
        
            <p>There were 21 deaths in the last two years over the holiday period, and 16 for the 2021-2022 period.</p>
        
            <p>Lower North Island / Top of the South regional manager Mark Owen said holidays are about making happy memories.</p>
        
            <p>"We want people to stay safe when they head away for the holidays and enjoy the festive season. Please by patient on the roads and make sure you get to where you're going safely."</p>
        
            <p>Owen said too often small mistakes have devastating consequences.</p>
        
            <p>"Driver distraction, fatigue, impatience - they can all lead bad decisions. And remember, it's not just you that bears the brunt of a mistake. It is also your passengers, other drivers on the road around you, and anyone in the near vicinity.</p>
        
            <p>"Never drive tired, turn your cellphone off, watch your speed and following distances, and always pass safely," Owen said.</p>
        
            <p>But most important of all, he wanted people to ensure their seatbelts are on.</p>
        
            <p>"It is the simplest thing to do and, if the worst happens, it can mean the difference between life or death. Please, make it click," Owen said.</p>
        
            <p>He also recommended drivers take the time to use the NZTA/Waka Kotahi Journey Planner when heading on a holiday road trip.</p>
        
            <p>"Nothing is worse than being stuck in traffic in a hot car on a warm summer's day. Our holiday journey planner shows you when and where the peak traffic times will be."</p>
        
            <p>"If you can, time your trip to avoid these times. Your passengers will very likely thank you for it," Owen said.</p>
