            <p>A man has been arrested after brandishing a BB gun during a road rage incident in west Auckland on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called after a witness saw a man pull out a gun and threaten construction workers on West Coast Road, between Glen Eden and Kelston mall.</p>
        
            <p>The witness said the man was yelling obscenities, pulled the middle finger, before gesturing with what appeared to be a firearm as he drove away.</p>
        
            <p>A police eagle helicopter was deployed to the area and tracked down the vehicle to an address on Great North Road in New Lynn.</p>
        
            <p>Ground units cordoned off the property, before the alleged offender exited the house, and a BB gun was discovered by police.</p>
