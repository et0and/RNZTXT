            <p>A class action against the Earthquake Commission (EQC) could be one of the most expensive in New Zealand's history.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Grant Shard said the EQC underpaid his clients after the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes.</p>
        
            <p>Thousands more people will be included in the class action, which was authorised on Friday. </p>
        
            <p>Shard said the commission originally settled claims based on repair costs, but switched to a cheaper alternative after the earthquakes.</p>
        
            <p>"Up until the land claims for the Christchurch earthquakes, it settled land claims based upon what it would cost to repair the damage to the land.</p>
        
            <p>"It realised part-way through that was going to cost a lot of money, so it came up with an alternative method that was going to cost a lot less.</p>
        
            <p>Under the old scheme, one of his clients would have been entitled to $200,000. Instead, they received $20,000, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The class action would be on an opt-out basis, so that anyone who fitted the criteria would be included automatically.</p>
        
            <p>"The next step will be to put together a communication that will go to all the members of the class, because this class action is on what's called an opt-out basis.</p>
        
            <p>"They will have a certain time to opt out if they want to, and then the class will be finalised."</p>
        
            <p>Shard said the process began in 2017 and could take two or three more years to resolve.</p>
        
            <p>The EQC said it was considering its next steps.</p>
