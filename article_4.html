            <p>Four people have been injured, one critically, following a crash in Hastings late on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>St John said it was called to the single vehicle crash on Korokipo Road, State Highway 50, in the rural community of Fernhill about 11.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>It took four people to Hawke's Bay hospital - one in a critical condition, two in a serious condition, and one in a moderate condition.</p>
        
            <p>Initial calls indicated people were trapped in the vehicle, but that was not the case when crews arrived, Fire and Emergency said.</p>
        
            <p>It sent two fire trucks and a support crew to the scene, and the team assisted police and ambulance staff.</p>
        
            <p>St John attended with three ambulances and a rapid response vehicle.</p>
