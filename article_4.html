            <p>A climber has died after slipping and falling on Mount Ruapehu.</p>
        
            <p>The woman was among a group climbing near Whangaehu Hut, on the eastern side of the mountain, on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the woman slipped and fell down a slope about 11am.</p>
        
            <p>She fell "a significant distance, suffering serious injuries", police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Emergency services, the Greenlea Rescue Helicopter, members of the Ruapehu Alpine Rescue Organisation, and Tukino Ski Field staff, responded immediately.</p>
        
            <p>"Sadly, despite their best efforts, the woman died at the scene."</p>
        
            <p>Police said their thoughts were with the woman's family and climbing companions.</p>
        
            <p>A rƒÅhui was in place on the eastern slopes of the mountain above 2000 metres, until 6am Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Sergeant Shane McNally called it a "tragic incident".</p>
        
            <p>"While the matter is still under investigation, we cannot reiterate enough the importance of understanding the alpine environment and being prepared mentally and physically for this unforgiving environment."</p>
