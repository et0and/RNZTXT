            <p>Trampers will be able to purchase a trail pass for New Zealand's longest walk - Te Araroa - for the first time this summer.</p>
        
            <p>Te Araroa Trust and the Department of Conservation have teamed up to create the $195 pass for the 2024-25 season which can be used to stay at 71 of DOC's huts and campsites along the way.</p>
        
            <p>DOC said the pass will save trampers money and provide DOC with better data on those using the trail.</p>
        
            <p>People who are walking Te Araroa in full, or the South Island portion, will be required to purchase the pass when they register for the walk.</p>
        
            <p>The pass will be optional for those walking just the North Island portion or small sections of the trail, as it may be cheaper to purchase tickets for the huts and campsites individually.</p>
        
            <p>Te Araroa Trust executive director Matt Claridge said the team was "very excited" about the trail pass.</p>
        
            <p>"Te Araroa is one of the world's most diverse long-distance walking trails, allowing people to experience the back country, towns and everything Aotearoa has to offer.</p>
        
            <p>"Around 2000 walkers complete the 3012km trail as a continuous journey every year, while many others walk parts of Te Araroa over the course of several years.</p>
        
            <p>"Providing additional value for walkers means a better experience for all and contributions from walkers help us ensure Te Araroa is a regenerative trail, with a lasting legacy."</p>
