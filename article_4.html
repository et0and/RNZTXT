            <p>Yet another music festival has been cancelled, as the the Paradise City Festival will no longer go ahead, with organisers citing low ticket sales as the main reason.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, due to low ticket numbers, we were unable to provide this experience. These decisions are never easy, but that left us with no choice but for Paradise City Festival to no longer go ahead," Paradise City Rock Festival said on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>
Several commenters on the post said they had never heard of the festival.

            <p>Headlined by American act Alien Ant Farm and New Zealand group Blindspott, the festival was originally planned for 5 February at the Trust Arena in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>In its post on Facebook Paradise City Rock Festival asked ticket holders to check their emails, and that five working days should be allowed for refunds.</p>
        
            <p>Several commenters on the post said they had never heard of the festival. "Promotion is key," said one.</p>
        
            <p>This followed last year's announcement that Bay Dreams would not return in 2025 and the cancellation of Juicy Fest earlier in the summer.</p>
        
            <p>Juicy Fest said its cancellation was a result of an inability to obtain alcohol licences, while Bay Dreams said it struggled in the face of rising costs and attracting international talent.</p>
