            <p>A pair on the Te Araroa national trail, which traverses the entire country, have been trespassed from a section of a Southland farm which the trail passes through.</p>
        
            <p>Just outside Invercargill, the track goes through a combination of DOC owned, public, and private land, including privately owned, Mt Linton Station.</p>
        
            <p>"One walker was heading south through the station and deliberately left the marked trail to take a short cut through an active logging site," trail manager Dan Radford said on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"The second was caught crossing the station by bike to meet the other walker."</p>
        
            <p>The pair were subsequently trespassed from Mt Linton Station after the incident on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Te Araroa Trust, the group which manages the national trail, said it supported the decision.</p>
        
            <p>"These decisions were a result of failing to read, comprehend and respect the trail notes, which Te Araroa Trust provide to keep walkers safe," Radford said.</p>
        
            <p>It was worsened by the nature of where they took the shortcut, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It is dangerous - statistically, logging and agriculture are two of the most dangerous workplaces in NZ, and both occur regularly along Te Araroa."</p>
        
            <p>Trust executive director Matt Caldridge said it was very unlikely the shortcut was taken by accident.</p>
        
            <p>The pair would have had to ignore warning signage, advice provided by the trust, and gone off a marked trail, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The information is clearly laid out and in this case there is absolutely no excuse for what the walkers did."</p>
        
            <p>He said despite the unfortunate nature of the incident, it was an anomaly amongst walkers.</p>
        
            <p>He could not recall another time when a walker on the Te Araroa trail had been trespassed.</p>
        
            <p>"We had 3000 walkers on the trail last year and this season and so to have two trespassers - the first time we believe walkers have been trespassed, so its incredibly rare."</p>
