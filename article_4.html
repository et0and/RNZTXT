            <p>Emergency services have left Wellington Airport following an issue with an Air New Zealand flight from Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said Hazmat crews were sent to assist the Airport Fire Service after an unusual smell was reported on a plane that landed about 8.30pm Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The issue was a suspected gas leak, a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Crews had been stood down by 10pm.</p>
        
            <p>Two Air New Zealand flights, one from Auckland and the other from Sydney, each had their arrivals delayed by about an hour.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ journalist said their flight from Auckland to Wellington was met by emergency services after it touched down.</p>
        
            <p>A handful of police were at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers were all off the flight and the situation was very calm, they said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was an 'engineering delay' when we took off in Auckland."</p>
        
            <p>It smelled like there had been an aviation gas leak, the staffer said.</p>
        
            <p>Another RNZ staffer, who was due to catch the same plane on the next flight from Wellington to Auckland, said their flight - NZ458 - had been cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Staff at the airport were trying to get people on new flights or book them accommodation for the night, she said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Air New Zealand chief operational integrity and safety officer Captain David Morgan said the crew of NZ453 reported an odour in the aircraft cabin shortly before landing.</p>
        
            <p>"As is standard operating procedure, the pilots notified air traffic control, which resulted in a local standby at Wellington Airport.</p>
        
            <p>"The aircraft proceeded to Wellington and landed safely after 8pm this evening where it taxied to the gate as normal. Our engineering team will now inspect the aircraft before it re-enters service."</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand thanked affected passengers for their patience and understanding, Morgan said.</p>
