            <p>Kiwi pizza fans can now enjoy an authentic Italian slice made by one of the best pizzaiolos (pizza makers) in the world - Enis Bacova.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, Bacova, a chef at Dante's, won third prize in the Neapolitan category at the Caputo Cup, aka the world pizza champs.</p>
        
            <p>At this year's competition in Naples, Bacova beat out all but one of 700 other competitors to bring home the silver trophy.</p>
        
            <p>Bacova's winning pizza, which he calls The Five Ps, featured a black crust (in honour of the All Blacks) and was topped with provolone cheese, pancetta, potato cream, pea cream and pecorino.</p>
        
            <p>Amidst "fierce competition" from Italian chefs in their own backyard, he thinks The Five Ps' combination of flavours, including a dough infused with charcoal carbon, was what set his pizza apart for the four Caputo Cup judges.</p>
        
            <p>A true Neapolitan pizza is made with heavily hydrated dough, Bacova says, and cooked very quickly in a hot woodfired oven.</p>
        
            <p>The sourdough crust must be airy, fluffy and what he calls "crunchy-spongy" - crunchy on the outside and spongy and inside.</p>
        
            <p>Pizza made in this way is much easier to digest than commercial pizza, says co-owner Kevin Morris, who opened Dante's 17 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>After growing up in the UK on his Mum's authentic Italian food, he found New Zealand pizza shockingly bad when he moved here in the '90s.</p>

            <p>Dante's - which is named after Morris' Italian grandfather - was the first New Zealand pizzeria to receive accreditation by Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (aka The True Neapolitan Pizza Association).</p>
        
            <p>In 2013, Bacova, who was born in Albania and trained as a pizzaiolo in Naples, joined the team.</p>
        
            <p>Dante's Auckland is now ranked in the top 50 pizza restaurants worldwide.</p>
        
            <p>Bacova encourages Auckland pizza-lovers to taste the authentic offerings at one of their three locations - Ponsonby Central, Takapuna and Mission Bay, where he is stationed.</p>
        
            <p>"You guys need to come and try for yourself one of the best pizzas in the world."</p>
