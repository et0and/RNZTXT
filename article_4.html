            <p>A second man has been arrested in relation to the murder of Ariki Rigby, whose body was found in a burned-out car in a Hawke's Bay reserve two years ago.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old Havelock North man has been charged with being a party to arson.</p>
        
            <p>He will appear in the Hastings District Court on Saturday. Police will oppose his bail.</p>
        
            <p>It follows the arrest of a 32-year-old Auckland man last month. That man has been charged with murder and has been remanded in custody to appear in the Napier High Court on 11 October.</p>
        
            <p>Rigby, 18, was killed in September 2022, during an unplanned holiday to see her father and stepmother.</p>
        
            <p>Her body was found in a dark grey Toyota Corona in River Road reserve near Havelock North.</p>
