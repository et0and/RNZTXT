            <p>Bargaining talks between train operator Transdev and the union representing rail workers in Wellington have not finished after a full day of negotiations.</p>
        
            <p>Commuter chaos continued across the Wellington region today, with 26 trains cancelled and a further 27 replaced by buses since Midday.</p>
        
            <p>Union members have been working to rule since Tuesday, meaning staff are taking all their breaks and refusing overtime or shift changes.</p>
        
            <p>Both Transdev and the union were optimistic that a resolution to end the contract dispute could have been sorted today.</p>
        
            <p>Another meeting is planned for Monday with the mediator.</p>
        
            <p>Some people were stranded for hours after major disruptions on the train network on Wednesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink's Samantha Gain says passengers should keep a close eye on the Metlink website or app to stay informed of service disruptions.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink, which runs the network, said it was encouraging both Transdev and the union to negotiate in good faith and resolve their differences as soon as possible.</p>
        
            <p>More talks had been scheduled for Monday, with the mediator as a back-up in case a resolution had not been made.</p>
        
            <p>The industrial dispute is between the train operator Transdev and the Rail and Maritime Transport Union.</p>
