            <p>Scientists have lowered the volcanic activity level for Whakaari / White Island after a minor eruption.</p>
        
            <p>The alert level was earlier set at three out of six after Friday morning's explosion which scientists described as minor.</p>
        
            <p>They say it was short-lived with a small amount of ash falling onto the northern part of the island.</p>
        
            <p>There have been no other eruptions during the day.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday evening, GNS Science lowered the alert level to two, which indicates moderate to heightened volcanic unrest.</p>
        
            <p>But the potential for eruption was still there, and it could occur with little or no warning, GNS Science said.</p>
        
            <p>GNS Science volcanologist Geoff Kilgour told Midday Report the eruption rose to about 3km, but activity had been quiet since.</p>

            <p>Earlier, scientists were sent out to the island in a helicopter to see what had happened after the eruption.</p>
        
            <p>"Activity on Whakaari / White Island has now returned to more normal levels with steam and gas emissions from active vents."</p>
        
            <p>Boiling water and steam bursting out of the crater lake on the island was stronger on Friday than it had been in the past few months, GNS Science said. It had been going as high as about 20-30m for several seconds.</p>
        
            <p>"These observations suggest that the eruption this morning was most likely gas driven and we have no indications of fresh magma being close to the surface.</p>
        
            <p>"We are preparing a gas flight for Monday to measure current levels of gas emission."</p>
        
            <p>No ashfall on the mainland was expected due to the south-west winds blowing it out to sea.</p>
        
            <p>GNS Science said it would continue to monitor the island for any changes.</p>
        
            <p>A deadly eruption of the volcano killed 22 people and injured 25 others in 2019.</p>
