        <h2>No plan for Southland town's homeless</h2>
        <p>
Efforts to target the issue with a new approach have come up empty-handed, a community board chair says.

            <p>Homelessness is increasing in Te Anau without any long-term support for those affected, a Fiordland conceptual plan has revealed.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, efforts to target the issue with a new approach have come up empty-handed, a community board chair says.</p>
        
            <p>The Te Anau Basin Development Plan was released last month with a goal of helping the Fiordland Community Board make future decisions.</p>

            <p>It covered a range of topics, including the local economy, population trends and housing.</p>
        
            <p>Regarding the latter, issues were highlighted around a lack of affordable housing in Te Anau as well as an increasing need for elderly accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>Homelessness was on the rise, for which there was no long-term support in the area, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Although there was a steady stream of houses being built, that number was not an accurate representation of availability, because of the amount which were holiday homes or short-term rentals.</p>
        
            <p>This increased the need for social housing, which was also exacerbated by the cost of land and building.</p>
        
            <p>Fiordland Community Board chair Diane Holmes said accommodation issues had been on the town's radar for decades, adding that it was a nationwide problem.</p>
        
            <p>Feedback from social workers indicated some families were doing it tough without appropriate housing, but central government had pared back support, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've reached out to a lot of other agencies and tried multi-agency approaches and might as well just be banging our head against a brick wall."</p>
        
            <p>Holmes was optimistic about the report as a whole, saying it highlighted Te Anau was well placed for both residential and commercial building moving forward.</p>
        
            <p>The Luxmore subdivision - undertaken in 2022 - allowed for more intensive building with up to three dwellings on a single section, she said.</p>
        
            <p>The report showed that an essential industry in the area, tourism, was also contributing to the housing challenge.</p>
        
            <p>Short-term rentals were important for visitor accommodation which supported the sector, but also had implications for long-term housing.</p>
        
            <p>Community engagement was a key factor in formulating the development plan, with the end product noting people had discussed a wide range of topics.</p>
        
            <p>That included increased density, vulnerability to natural disasters and the location of the school in the town centre.</p>
