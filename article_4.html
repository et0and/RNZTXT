            <p>Seven people were arrested for trespass after refusing to leave the Tarawera Sewerage worksite during a sewerage pipeline protest at Lake Rotokākahi, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Police said about 80 officers met protesters on Monday night.</p>
        
            <p>The protesters said Tūhourangi and Ngāti Tūmatawera and supporters were peacefully holding space to oppose the sewer line through a wāhi tapu site.</p>
        
            <p>Rotorua Lakes Council contractors were due to resume work on Monday night to enable the last 1.3km of pipeline in the Tarawera Sewerage Scheme to resume being laid.</p>
        
            <p>Protect Rotokākahi spokesperson Te Whatanui Leka Taumalolo Skipwith said they were attempting to protect what was sacred.</p>
        
            <p>"And what is that? The whenua, which is the environment, and the waters that I'm sure everyone in the country sees as a precious valuable thing ... because we need those things in order for us to survive and to thrive."</p>
        
            <p>He said 100 officers were there, as protesters were singing waiata and were in their whenua.</p>
        
            <p>"Our people weren't even in the injunction area," he told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>Police have been asked for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Opposition to the project, including from the group that oversees the iwi-owned lake, has forced work to pause several times, Local Democracy Reporting reported.</p>
        
            <p>A court-ordered injunction in November banned interference with construction.</p>
        
            <p>The project would connect hundreds of Tarawera households to the town sewerage system and aimed to reduce lake pollution.</p>
        
            <p>The pipeline's proximity to Lake Rotokākahi saw some mana whenua from Tūhourangi and Ngāti Tūmatawera occupy a portion of the lake, claiming it is a wāhi tapū (sacred site) where many of their tīpuna (ancestors) were killed and buried following the eruption of Mount Tarawera in 1886.</p>
