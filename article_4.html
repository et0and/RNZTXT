            <p>A prominent gang member will be farewelled Saturday afternoon and large numbers of mourners have travelled into Hawke's Bay, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our role remains to give mourners the respect and space to grieve, while also enhancing public trust and confidence and upholding the law," Hawke's Bay Area Commander Inspector Lincoln Sycamore said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have continued engagement with the community, gang leaders and members, and the deceased's whānau over the past few days."</p>
        
            <p>The deceased will lie in Percy Spiller Ave in Maraenui overnight, ahead of a funeral at Napier Tech clubrooms in Barker Road at 1pm Saturday, followed by burial at Wharerangi Lawn Cemetery off Prebensen Drive from 3pm.</p>
        
            <p>Police said locals should expect heavy traffic around these locations.</p>
        
            <p>The deceased's whānau have a Traffic Management Plan in place, and Māori Wardens and contractors will be assisting.</p>
        
            <p>There will be a number of checkpoints on roads around Napier, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be no tolerance for breaches of the law, including the Gangs Act 2024, nor for any unsafe or intimidating behaviour," Sycamore said.</p>
