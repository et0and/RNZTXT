            <p>Cases of Covid-19 are up on last week, as a new, highly transmissible subvariant XEC arrives in in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>There have been 886 new cases of Covid-19 reported in New Zealand over the week to Sunday, and six further deaths attributed to the virus.</p>
        
            <p>There were 89 people in hospital with the virus.</p>

            <p>The latest Health NZ figures come as a new, highly transmissible sub-variant arrives in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the first cases of XEC were reported in the country. This strain is a mix of two previous Omicron subvariants. A recombinant variant is created when a person is infected with two strains of a virus that then reproduce, resulting in a different strain.</p>
        
            <p>It has been reported in about 30 other countries, including Australia.</p>
        
            <p>ESR has detected a number of cases of the new strain in clinical samples.</p>
        
            <p>Professor Paul Griffin from the University of Queensland told Checkpoint XEC seemed to be more infectious than other subvariants.</p>
        
            <p>"In many parts of the world it's predicted it'll be dominant, perhaps even by the middle of this month."</p>
        
            <p>Griffin added people needed to maintain a certain level of readiness and mitigating strategies.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment, I think one of our biggest challenges is actually complacency.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact that we've got a new subvariant that's looking more infectious than taking over in many parts of the world, it should be a reminder that we need to keep up some of those basic strategies like vaccination, antivirals and simple measures to reduce getting infected and onward transmission."</p>
        
            <p>Last week, Te Whatu Ora reported 1174 new cases and five further deaths.</p>
