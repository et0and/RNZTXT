            <p>Wild holiday weather has left Cook Strait ferry passengers bracing for a rough ride, and some New Year's Eve crossings cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>A strong southerly swell meant two Interislander sailings between Wellington and Picton were cancelled on the morning of New Year's Eve, while Bluebridge cancelled all six of its New Year's Eve sailings.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers disembarking in Wellington during the afternoon of 31 December, said people had been sick during their crossing - and those waiting to board the return service said they were feeling a little nervous.</p>

            <p>Charlotte, who had travelled from Masterton with her twin 11-year-olds, said it was her whānau's first time visiting the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>She admitted to being a bit anxious about the trip, and checking in, but had been looked after well by staff.</p>
        
            <p>Her daughters were looking forward to the 10-day holiday in Tākaka she said, but were worried about the ride ahead.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very exciting for them, but they're a little bit nervous about a potential rough sailing."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile Rudi, a traveller from Germany who had been biking through the motu, said he felt relaxed about crossing the Strait.</p>
        
            <p>"It's okay, it's not the first ferry cruise I've done, so I don't expect anything different."</p>
        
            <p>Spaniard Gonzalo, said he was sailing to Picton then immediately returning to Wellington - and although the weather was a bit of a bummer, had heard the Marlborough Sounds were worth it.</p>
        
            <p>"I was considering cancelling, but it's the only time I'm going to be in New Zealand, so I might as well do it."</p>

            <p>Also sailing back-and-forth today was ship entertainer Siofra Martin, who would be playing games with the kids and making balloon animals.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was only her second sailing, but she was feeling optimistic about her ability to cope with the weather.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't been on a lot [of] boats, so I guess we'll see. I think I'll be okay, I don't usually get motion-sickness.</p>
        
            <p>"As long as I'm not looking outside too much."</p>
        
            <p>She said eating ice chips could help with the nausea, so would be sending unwell kids to their parents with that advice.</p>

            <p>On its website, Interislander said travellers who get seasick should try to avoid spicy greasy food and alcohol before their trip, but should not sail on an empty stomach. They recommend seabands and ginger as remedies worth trying, or talking to a pharmacist about over-the counter drugs, as well as sitting closer to the back of the ship where the movement is reduced.</p>
