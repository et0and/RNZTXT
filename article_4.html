        <h2>Gardens flooded, homes threatened as heavy rain hits Wānaka</h2>
        <p>
Heavy rain filled a Wānaka developer's water retention plant to over-capacity, forcing contractors to release water onto a road, flooding gardens and threatening homes.

            <p>Heavy rain overnight filled a Wānaka developer's water retention plant to over-capacity, forcing contractors to release water down Wineberry Lane onto Aubrey Road, resulting in gardens being flooded and houses being sandbagged.</p>
        
            <p>An Otago Daily Times reporter at the scene said an engineer, a flood prevention manager, contractors, the Wānaka's Fire Brigade and a digger were on site working to control the water flow this morning.</p>
        
            <p>The reporter said an engineer at the site explained that a controlled water release was the best of two bad scenarios.</p>
        
            <p>Letting the pond burst would have created a "tidal wave'' of water that would have been even worse.</p>
        
            <p>A steady stream of water was flowing down hill at 10.30am, the ODT reporter said.</p>
