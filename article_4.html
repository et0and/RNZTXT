            <p>There will be a high police presence in Hawke's Bay on Monday as they monitor the tangi of a senior Mongrel Mob member.</p>
        
            <p>More than 100 gang members and associates were expected to attend the service, where the body will be taken from Mahora to Moteo in the morning for burial.</p>
        
            <p>Police said their focus was on protecting the public and minimising disruption to the community.</p>
        
            <p>They said they would take "every opportunity" to enforce the law, including the ban on gang patches.</p>
        
            <p>Additional police staff from neighbouring districts will help with the operation.</p>
        
            <p>Police will be running checkpoints to breath test drivers and check vehicles are roadworthy.</p>
        
            <p>"Illegal, antisocial or disruptive behaviour won't be tolerated," Detective Inspector Martin James said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone in the community has the right to be safe and feel safe."</p>
        
            <p>He urged anyone who saw illegal behaviour to call 111 it it was happening then, or 105 after the fact.</p>
