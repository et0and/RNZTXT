            <p>Meterologists say the unseasonable cold snap that has derailed summer for many parts of the country is set to linger on for at least another week.</p>
        
            <p>But MetService has reassured residents and holidaymakers that summer is far from done, and that sizzling temperatures will return for some parts as early as Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The mercury in central Otago is set to exceed 30 degrees on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Elsewhere, the country has experienced a dip in temperatures, particularly in southern and eastern parts of both islands, off the back of strong southerlies sweeping up the country.</p>
        
            <p>Meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said the summer period had enjoyed a warm onset in early-December.</p>
        
            <p>"Many might be wondering where summer has gone," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"That said, there will be glimpses of summer weather in between the unsettled conditions."</p>
        
            <p>Fierce southerlies engulfed Wellington's Basin Reserve on Sunday for the first New Zealand-Sri Lanka one day international, forcing some freezing spectators to drape themselves in blankets.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really windy out there, it's a bit colder than Sri Lanka," Janith Liyanage told TVNZ's Craig McMillan.</p>
        
            <p>Although biting temperatures at the Basin are not a completely novel experience for Wellingtonians, MetService meteorologist John Law said the majority of the country had endured a rough start to the year.</p>
        
            <p>He said the country has been enclosed by a low pressure system to the east, and a high pressure system to the west.</p>
        
            <p>"[They're] really helping direct that cold air up from the Southern Ocean and further south towards the Antarctic up and across.</p>
        
            <p>"It's cold enough to bring some flurries of snow across the very higher parts of the country.</p>
        
            <p>As seen in a video posted on social media on Sunday, one traveller along the Desert Road was baffled by the sight of snowfall.</p>
        
            <p>The strong southerlies had also caused rough swells in Cook Strait, leading to major disruption for both Interislander and Bluebridge services in the past 48 hours, affecting thousands of passengers.</p>
        
            <p>Law said the colder temperatures would continue for most parts into next week with a return to normal expected in a fortnight.</p>
        
            <p>The average January temperatures for the country's main centres sat between 19 and 24.4 degrees.</p>
        
            <p>Eastern parts of the North Island have been copping the brunt of rainfall to begin the week with the Wairoa District under a heavy rain watch all of Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The district had copped 300 millimetres of rain since the start of December.</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa mayor Craig Little said had been a very cold and wet start to the season.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd love to have a summer too," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's quite wet underground and underfoot at the moment.</p>
        
            <p>"We also got home from a wedding in Hawke's Bay on Saturday where it had been a beautiful day, but when we got home it was freezing.</p>
        
            <p>"For this time of year, very cold."</p>
        
            <p>Other parts of the country had escaped the gloomy climate.</p>
        
            <p>Bay of Plenty and western parts of the South Island had been basking in sunshine.</p>
        
            <p>Westport hotelier David Hingston said the usually sodden town was right now "the best spot in the country".</p>
        
            <p>"People are walking around in t-shirts and shorts and looking really comfortable.</p>
        
            <p>"After a horrid winter, people come out of hibernation and just enjoy.</p>
        
            <p>"People are out and about enjoying themselves, going down the beach, going for walks on the trails, going cycling."</p>
