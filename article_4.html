        <h2>Sir Edmund Hillary's daughter joins 'historic' marathon</h2>
        <p>
The Aotearoa Afghanistan Marathon aims to encourage inclusivity, empower women, and bring pride in cultural traditions.
</p>
        
            <p>Sarah Hillary, the daughter of Sir Edmund Hillary, says she would love to see the return of the Aotearoa Afghanistan Marathon - labelled as historic by its organisers - to bridge the communities.</p>
        
            <p>Hillary was among more than 200 runners who took part in the marathon at Riverhead, northwest Auckland, on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>It offered three medals made of natural gemstones from Afghanistan for male, female and child winners in the 6km, 21km, and 42km courses.</p>

            <p>The hilly gravel path was chosen in a bid to recreate the conditions of Afghanistan's Bamyan region - where the marathon originated from in 2015, in a standout moment for female participation in public sports within the country.</p>
        
            <p>Despite spending the past eight months recovering from some injuries, 68-year-old Hillary, who is well known for her arts conservator career, says she was keen to take part in building connections with the Afghani women who had left their country since the takeover by the Taliban.</p>
        
            <p>"It was so lovely to have this particular reason for the race, getting the women more freedom, you know, they're having more freedom now that they're living in New Zealand and getting the community involved.</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>"There's nothing like direct communication with people and meeting people. It's never as good to read about them online.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got different values, but actually having connection and meeting people and doing things like running or walking is a great way to learn how to understand each other."</p>
        
            <p>She hopes it will become an annual event and encouraged participation, saying she'd be keen to go again.</p>

            <p>Former soccer player Ali Ahmad Rajiy, 74, who took part in the 6km course, received a raucous cheer and applause as he crossed the finish line.</p>
        
            <p>"I participated because of all the Afghan community members here. If they see me at my age that I'm running, they should be more motivated to run," a friend translating on his behalf told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm very emotional about the situation of the people in Afghanistan, and [I'm] happy to see the people here enjoying."</p>
        
            <p>Co-organiser Timatanga Hou board member Amir Foldadi says it was a unique opportunity for Afghans to showcase their culture and foster integration between the communities.</p>
        
            <p>"The Kiwis were really happy to be part of such a historic event," Foldai says, adding it was likely the first time that Afghans took part in such an event on this scale with Kiwis in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"They actually run in many different marathons, but this marathon was somehow very special for them."</p>
        
            <p>Foladi hopes more Afghans will be inspired to join after seeing one of the community's male participants win third place in the 6km category.</p>

            <p>Malika Safadri, who completed her first marathon - the 21km course - in just under two hours, holds that same dream for her community too.</p>
        
            <p>"I didn't mind if I wasn't the winner, but I was obsessed with the challenge it brought for me to start walking, running and I feel so good today that I'm here," the 26-year-old says.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a hard life in Afghanistan, we never had time to go for like exercise, running or anything, no gym at all, nothing.</p>
        
            <p>"But here when we saw the opportunity for us kind of like today… I feel so good to come with people and talk with them … today as you see it's a crowded gathering today, it's given me more energy to think about future."</p>

Ziba fashion co-owner Shookria Basir says having cultural exhibitions at events like the Aotearoa Afghanistan Marathon can help children and future generations learn and teach others about their identity.

            <p>One of the event sponsors, Shookria Basir - who has been co-running Ziba Fashion retail for about two years - says while they don't know what the future holds for Afghanistan, this is an important way to keep their traditions thriving to teach the future generations.</p>
        
            <p>"That's one of the reasons that made me start my business was introducing my country and culture into the market.</p>
        
            <p>"They've been growing up in a society that makes them hard to know where they have come from, what is their culture, what we used to wear, what our grandparents wore … making programmes and introducing them to the community is one of the ways to make your kids remember what you are and where you're from, but also it's [about] bringing everybody together … and that's how kids learn different cultures, different backgrounds."</p>

            <p>It was also an extra special day for the Van Den Hout trio, who were celebrating two birthdays and won two medals.</p>
        
            <p>Amy and Anna Den Hout took home second and third place, while Anna's boyfriend took home third place in the men's 6km run too.</p>
        
            <p>"When I saw that it was a special organisation for helping people integrate and stuff, I thought that's so cool, I'd love to be part of that as well," Amy, who just turned 50, says.</p>
        
            <p>"They're so welcoming to us and they're cheering us when we go past and we're cheering them, and it just feels connected and anything that's promoting women and freedom, it's just so nice to be part of."</p>
        
            <p>"It's a cool combination of culture and running and especially a culture that we're unfamiliar with, and that's outside of New Zealand," 22-year-old Anna says.</p>

            <p>Winner of the 21km in the men's category, Johan Kvasnicka says he runs with a group at the Riverhead Forest Trail every week but he was excited by the prospect of having a unique medal.</p>
        
            <p>"The funny thing is once you put an event on, it suddenly becomes different. So, I found I could run a lot fast during the event, because of the community and atmosphere.</p>
        
            <p>"I really like the idea of allowing people to run all over the world. I feel like it's something everyone could benefit. And also I really like the way that the event has been organised to be both a running event and a cultural experience, I feel like that's something that could be very popular in the future."</p>

            <p>The Afghani organisers of the marathon, from the New Beginnings Foundation (Timatanga Hou), were involved in running social activities for Bamyan locals, some of which also saw the Defence Force participate, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's then-NZ Aid programme.</p>
        
            <p>Among them was a skiing and avalanche safety programme, which Kiwi Simon Shelton helped with for four months in 2013. Despite apprehension about going due to the war, he says it turned out to be the most amazing experience.</p>
        
            <p>"We had the ski challenge which I loved because all the locals won it because it was at high altitude. So skiiers and strong skiiers like myself and us other Westerners would come in, and think they were going to be really good, but it was all the uphill and trying to climb at altitude, and the locals would just fly up there."</p>

            <p>Having seen the Hazara ethnic people - who lived in Bamyan - as "a symbol of resilience and grit" and a source of inspiration for him, he flew over from Christchurch to take part in the 42km course.</p>
        
            <p>"I also like the idea that it raises awareness across New Zealand about what's happened and what New Zealand has done… but you know you need more than just some money, some houses and education, you also need to integrate them into society and make them feel welcomed.</p>
        
            <p>"When I was there, the governor of the Bamyan region was a female and that made me very proud, and it showed me there was progress and the Hazara were different and were happy to challenge norms."</p>
