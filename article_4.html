        <h2>Watch: Timaru's Smithfield workers mull future</h2>
        <p>
Hundreds of Alliance meatworks staff are bracing for the worst as a final decision on the long-standing plant is revealed this morning.
</p>
        
            <p>South Canterbury man Ray Bowman did not muck around when he learned that he - like hundreds others at Smithfield - was facing probable redundancy.</p>
        
            <p>The 45-year-old stopped at the local Four Square, bought a box of beer, then went home and drunk it.</p>
        
            <p>He woke up the next morning and told himself, "I need to get a job."</p>
        
            <p>Having worked several years at the Timaru meatworks since finishing high school, in between a decade-long stint across the Tasman, Bowman established himself as an experienced toiler within the plant's boning room.</p>
        
            <p>Bowman had been planning to work at Smithfield until he retired.</p>
        
            <p>That was until the plant's owners Alliance brought those aspirations to a standstill last month.</p>
        
            <p>"It was pretty hard," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had just built a house and I was looking to have my future there."</p>
        
            <p>Read more:</p>
        
            <p>The following Monday, he and his family drove an hour north to Ashburton and by the time they left, Bowman had secured a job at the local meat processors.</p>
        
            <p>It was a major weight off for the Pleasant Point father.</p>
        
            <p>"I had to," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got all of this going on, I've got kids. I couldn't wait, I've got to work."</p>

            <p>Hundreds of Bowman's colleagues are bracing for the worst as a final decision on the long-standing plant is revealed on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Alliance workers will learn their fate during an all-staff meeting at 9am, with management expected to confirm the closure of the 139-year-old site, a move that would leave about 600 employees out of work.</p>
        
            <p>The meat co-operative announced a proposal, to discontinue sheep meat, calves and venison processing, to shocked employees last month.</p>
        
            <p>It followed a loss of almost $98 million for the 12-month period ending September 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Venison processing would continue at the plant until the end of the year before being decommissioned.</p>
        
            <p>Consultation on the plan ended last week, although it is understood a pre-shutdown cleanout was already under way at the plant.</p>
        
            <p>The situation has left many other workers grappling with their future prospects.</p>

PJ Speechly says the stress and uncertainty has affected her sleep.

            <p>Smithfield worker PJ Speechly admitted the stress and uncertainty had resulted in little sleep.</p>
        
            <p>"We've spoken to our bank and mortgage lenders to put our mortgage on holiday," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just the uncertainty of what's happening on Friday because we don't know when it (redundancy) will be paid out, or if we've got jobs.</p>
        
            <p>"Even going forward, to get another permanent job, they're asking, 'When can you start?'</p>
        
            <p>"Technically, we're still employed."</p>
        
            <p>It was not the first dilemma the Pleasant Point woman had faced during her time at Alliance.</p>
        
            <p>Speechly was previously employed at Christchurch's Sockburn plant that closed in 2012, a result of an Alliance reshuffle of its beef and processing facilities.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>With history set to repeat and no set plan beyond Friday's staff meeting, Speechly was seeing this as an opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought about approaching [MSD] for re-training because I've been in that industry for so long, my computer skills aren't what they probably should be, with school-leavers as competition," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just about finding reemployment."</p>
        
            <p>Alliance Group chief executive Willie Wiese had put the proposed closure down to "a decline in sheep processing numbers as a result of land-use changes".</p>
        
            <p>Although Bowman said the co-op had done plenty for him and the community, he remained dubious on Alliance's rationale.</p>
        
            <p>"How did they lose $98 million, or are they sitting on a lot of stock that they haven't sold?</p>
        
            <p>"When you make a lot of money over the last 10 years, as far as I'm aware the company's been doing quite well.</p>
        
            <p>"It can't be lambs and forestry, it would have to be the way it's been managed."</p>
        
            <p>Smithfield's closure is expected to cost the local economy between $90-$100m per year, a forecast that had sent shudders through the local business sector.</p>
        
            <p>South Canterbury Chamber of Commerce chief executive Wendy Smith said businesses were "deeply concerned".</p>
        
            <p>"Alliance has been here for a long time servicing this industry and servicing our community.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen a huge outreach from businesses looking to try and support workers should that decision be announced and it not be the one that we're hoping for."</p>
        
            <p>Timaru Mayor Nigel Bowen said some families would be forced to leave the area.</p>
        
            <p>"People are hurting and it'll be really hard if you're in that situation," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, the whole country is experiencing a downturn and that's when businesses make these decisions.</p>
        
            <p>"We need to be optimistic and look at what the opportunities are."</p>
        
            <p>The district remained a manufacturing stronghold and other businesses would be on the lookout for talent, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Bowen called on the government to ponder the upshot for the regions when implementing certain policies and legislation.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like central government to give some real thought, if they're focused on the ETS and carbon forestry, what does that mean for jobs and communities?"</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) had ramped up its local resource and had established a one-on-one support service.</p>
        
            <p>A cross-agency job fair - led by MSD, the South Canterbury Chamber of Commerce and economic development outfit Venture Timaru - is earmarked for next month.</p>
