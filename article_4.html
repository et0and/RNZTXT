            <p>Water restrictions have eased in Nelson as the current water supply is at higher levels than anticipated.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson City Council introduced stage 1 water restrictions on 1 December and moved into stage 2 restrictions on 20 December, given the predictions for a long, hot, dry summer.</p>
        
            <p>Group infrastructure manager Alec Louverdis said in previous years a similar forecast led to diminishing levels of water and required heavy measures to ensure adequate supply.</p>
        
            <p>Thanks to some wet weather and efforts of residents to conserve water, the restrictions could be lifted.</p>
        
            <p>Louverdis said while water levels were currently at a healthy level, that could change and restrictions could be re-introduced if required.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson receives its water from three sources. A direct weir on the south branch of the Maitai River, the Maitai dam with an intake on the north branch of the Maitai River and a low level dam with an intake on the Roding River.</p>
        
            <p>During the summer months the council's resource consent set river flow limits on the Roding River, which generally meant a halt on taking water from that source, increasing the reliance on the water stored in the Maitai Dam, Louverdis said.</p>
