            <p>Much of the Wellington region will move to level two water restrictions on Wednesday at midnight.</p>
        
            <p>The ban on all sprinklers and irrigation systems for residential homes will apply to Wellington, Porirua, Hutt, and Upper Hutt cities.</p>
        
            <p>People can still water their gardens with a hose at anytime as long as it is not left unattended.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Wellington Water said the decision had been made due to very high demand putting pressure on the drinking water supply.</p>
        
            <p>That demand peaked at 195 million litres on 9 January.</p>
        
            <p>The service provider said demand was likely to continue to grow with temperatures rising, people returning from holiday and the high number of leaks in the ageing pipe network.</p>
        
            <p>Drinking water, network development and delivery chief advisor Laurence Edwards said the restrictions would only apply to residential properties but businesses were being asked to pitch in.</p>
        
            <p>"We do ask that businesses across the district take steps to reduce their water usage where possible.</p>
        
            <p>"We are working with our client councils to provide guidance for non-residential customers, including on the restrictions that may apply at Level 3 and 4. If we all do our bit, then we can hopefully avoid further restrictions."</p>
        
            <p>He wanted to reassure residents that Wellington Water was working to find and fix as many leaks as possible within the funding and resources available.</p>
        
            <p>The latest data from the provider shows there are more than 3000 known leaks across the Wellington region's metropolitan area, with new ones popping up regularly.</p>
        
            <p>Edwards said residents were advised to shorten showers to four minutes, not run the tap while brushing their teeth and do full loads of washing.</p>
