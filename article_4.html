            <p>Auckland councillors are defending being hosted at Eden Park for events like concerts and sports matches.</p>
        
            <p>It has come to light ahead of next Thursday's vote on the city's stadium strategy of an updated Eden Park or a downtown stadium.</p>
        
            <p>Official documents under the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act show 15 of Auckland's 20 councillors have been hosted by Eden Park Trust since 1 January 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Waitākere councillor Shane Henderson, who is also chairperson of the council's stadiums working group, said he understood there was a perception issue from the public but reassured Aucklanders the stadium process had been above board.</p>
        
            <p>"There'll be people out there who might be a bit concerned about councillors accepting specifically from Eden Park Trust hospitality," said the Waitākere ward councillor.</p>
        
            <p>"I personally don't see an issue there but I understand how some people might feel that way.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think it would sway myself or any other councillors, being part of the process from the beginning there's been some very clear and rational discussions.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm super happy with it, and if there was any perception of any kind of bad behaviour then I would be the first to call it out, I think it's gone very well.</p>
        
            <p>"The other element for our job is that we have a civic function so we do have to represent the city and see how events work so we can discuss them with information when we're looking to the future," Henderson said.</p>
        
            <p>Albany Ward councillor John Watson agreed and said attending events was part of their role.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a wider part of your role, stadiums get substantial sums of money from the council and often people look for support or attendance of the decision makers to show how well things are going," Watson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's wider than just jacking up a free ticket I think most councillors would look at it as part of their overall role.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't see that I've compromised myself and I think most other councillors would feel the same," the Albany councillor said.</p>

            <p>On the 27 March, councillors will decide whether to back a new and improved Eden Park or a CBD option called Te Tōangaroa which is proposed to be beside Spark Arena, featuring a 50,000 seat stadium and an All Blacks branded hotel.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council will not put any money towards either option however.</p>
        
            <p>Julie Fairey, Alf Filipaina, Mike Lee and Sharon Stewart were the only councillors not to have accepted any gifts for events at Eden Park according to official documents.</p>
        
            <p>While Shane Henderson was not hosted by Eden Park Trust in the previous 15 months, he did take up offers from the Blues and Live Nation.</p>
        
            <p>Alf Filipaina said he had not taken up any hospitality offers from Eden Park Trust since January 2024 because of recent knee surgery and for musical reasons.</p>
        
            <p>"I have no issue at all around each of the councillors in regards to their decisions, because they know under the Local Government Act and what a conflict of interest is.</p>
        
            <p>"I've never been lobbied when I've gone there and that's the credibility I believe because if I did get lobbied, I wouldn't be accepting any more complimentary tickets," Filipaina said.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Auckland Council Elected Members Code of Conduct, members must declare any gift over the value of $500.</p>
