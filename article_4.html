        <h2>Police call Interpol, reveal new clues found on woman's body</h2>
        <p>
Police say they still haven't figured out who a woman pulled from Auckland's Gulf Harbour was and are calling for public help.
</p>
        
            <p>Police in Auckland say they have not yet been able to identify the body pulled from Gulf Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>A post mortem was conducted on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"We have established that the victim is a female and middle-aged," Acting Detective Inspector Tim Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>He could not be more specific about the age, but confirmed "it is not a child".</p>
        
            <p>Police have ruled out that the victim might be Yanfei Bao, who went missing from Christchurch in July.</p>

            <p>She was wearing blue pyjama bottoms with a pattern on it, and a light-coloured singlet with an emblem.</p>
        
            <p>"She's small in stature. We estimate the height to be around 160cm. We believe she's of Asian descent and our enquiries lead us to believe she's probably Chinese."</p>
        
            <p>Interpol had been contacted in the hope of identifying the woman, Williams said.</p>
        
            <p>A homicide investigation was launched after a fisherman found the body wrapped in plastic bags on Tuesday by the Gulf Harbour ferry terminal.</p>
        
            <p>"It is complex because we don't know who she is. Someone must be missing their mother, sister or grandma," Inspector Williams says.</p>
        
            <p>Police are also asking the public to help identify items of clothing found on the woman's bod</p>
        
            <p>Police say they are treating the crime very seriously, and acknowledge how unsettling it is to the community.</p>
        
            <p>They say they don't believe there is an ongoing risk to the public, but declined to say how the woman had died.</p>
