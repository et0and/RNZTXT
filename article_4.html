            <p>Project Jonah is responding to a mass stranding of 30 to 40 pilot whales at Farewell Spit.</p>
        
            <p>Spokeswoman Louisa Hawkes says a senior team is arriving with specialist equipment at the stranding location in the next half hour.</p>
        
            <p>Low tide is at 5.30pm so the focus will be on keeping the whales comfortable until dark and efforts to refloat the whales will resume again at first light.</p>
        
            <p>High tide is not until midnight so some of the senior team will stay with the whales as long as they can.</p>
        
            <p>More to come...</p>
