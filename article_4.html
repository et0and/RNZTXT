            <p>Aml has been living in New Zealand since January - it's the longest her family has stayed in one place in six months after she became one of nearly 2 million people who have been displaced across the Gaza strip</p>
        
            <p>Aml was born in Christchurch and moved to Gaza 20 years ago, while the rest of her family remained in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>But she was forced to make the long journey back to New Zealand to escape the dangers of the current Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>
        
            <p>Aml ran an engineering firm in Gaza with her husband, and her family's ordeal to return home began on 7 October 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"One morning we're getting my kids ready to go to school and all of a sudden at 6am, bombs are going off, missiles and everything is just chaotic.</p>
        
            <p>"We knew it was bad."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ, she broke down as she explained how they had to leave.</p>
        
            <p>The children, who had just started school, emptied their new backpacks and stuffed in two shirts each.</p>
        
            <p>Aml would later learn her house was razed as a result of the bombing.</p>
        
            <p>Her family and some of her in-laws who lived close by decided to take shelter at another relative's home.</p>
        
            <p>But just a day later, she said Israeli forces started sending text messages asking all residents in the area to evacuate.</p>
        
            <p>"We just headed for the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"We said we'll just wait in the hospital until the sun comes out so we can move in a safer way."</p>
        
            <p>They were now a group of more than 30 people looking for a safe place.</p>
        
            <p>After sunrise, they moved to a UN school in the adjacent city of Jabaliyah.</p>
        
            <p>But it was was already hemmed in with hundreds of other displaced families and they could only manage to stay for a day.</p>
        
            <p>Aml and her family went to take shelter at her sister-in-law's place in Central Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>She thought they were finally safe, until one night when she was talking to her parents in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I was telling them we're well, all good. Everything is well. Don't be scared."</p>
        
            <p>Then bombing began around the house. The glass on the windows shattered.</p>
        
            <p>Amid her screams, the metal door burst open and it suddenly got dark because the electricity was cut off.</p>
        
            <p>Ten days into the war, Aml's family moved for the fourth time.</p>
        
            <p>It is then that she realised she had to finally say goodbye to Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>"I contacted the New Zealand Embassy in Cairo. I sent them a message telling them that 'I need to please be evacuated'."</p>
        
            <p>The next morning Aml had to move again, this time to Khan Younis.</p>
        
            <p>"You can't think, you just need to pack and leave."</p>
        
            <p>She said it was moving constantly from place-to-place that saved their lives.</p>

            <p>Then she had some good news - a reply from the New Zealand embassy.</p>
        
            <p>They agreed to organise emergency passports for her children, a visa for her husband and to loan the family more than $20,000 for flights to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>But there was one more challenge - travel requires approval from Israeli authorities.</p>
        
            <p>"No one is allowed to go in or out of Gaza unless Israel is okay with it."</p>
        
            <p>She said Gaza was "a big prison".</p>
        
            <p>The approval finally came through two weeks later.</p>
        
            <p>But they were told to move as close to the Rafah border near Egypt, and wait for the embassy to give them the okay to cross.</p>
        
            <p>Aml and her family now moved to a school in Rafah with the rest of their relatives.</p>
        
            <p>She said the classrooms and other parts of the building were completely packed and a narrow staircase was the only place available to them.</p>
        
            <p>By now it was late November and it had been nearly six weeks since Aml left her home in North Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>Finally, she received a message to be at the Egyptian border the next morning.</p>
        
            <p>Aml's husband borrowed money for a 20-minute ride to the border.</p>
        
            <p>She said there were hundreds of people already there, sitting on the ground, waiting for their name to be called.</p>
        
            <p>There was just one toilet and that was out of service.</p>
        
            <p>But after a day of waiting, they were told to go back without an explanation.</p>
        
            <p>They eventually returned to the staircase and began waiting for another message.</p>
        
            <p>Two days later they were told to go to the border once more.</p>
        
            <p>This time there were New Zealand embassy staff, who waited with them.</p>
        
            <p>"They were so kind and so sweet when they got there, they they just gave us some food and gave us some water."</p>
        
            <p>She said being treated with such kindness made her feel safe.</p>
        
            <p>"We had to wait until our names were called so it was all day long, until I think it's 11pm that we were allowed to go into Egypt. We took the buses and we headed to Cairo."</p>
        
            <p>The family were told they could stay in Cairo for a maximum of 45 days - so they stayed as long as they could, hoping to return to rebuild their lives in Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>But the war was nowhere near coming to an end.</p>
        
            <p>Finally, four months after they first left home, Aml and her family arrived in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Her mum and brother flew in from Christchurch to meet her at Auckland airport.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first time her 10-year-old met his mum's whanau.</p>
        
            <p>It was an emotional reunion. She had waited for more than a decade to meet them.</p>
        
            <p>They took her from the airport to a hotel and the next day Aml and her family moved into Salvation Army accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>Her husband - who had been a civil engineer for more than 20 years - was on a visitor's visa and was not allowed to work. He also needed his qualifications to be recognised in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>For now, they will stay in Auckland, because it might be easier to make a fresh start here.</p>
        
            <p>The children have started school and she said they were happy and seemed like they had adjusted to their new country.</p>
        
            <p>They still get scared of loud noises and the police helicopter, she said.</p>
        
            <p>She had three years to pay the money loaned to her by the New Zealand government, but the escape from Gaza had cost a lot more than that.</p>
        
            <p>"We actually took thousands of dollars in debt from people we knew in Gaza."</p>
        
            <p>Without any source of income, she did not know how she will pay back the debt or meet daily expenses.</p>
        
            <p>She was relying on the community's generosity for help. and had set up a give-a-little page for anyone who wanted to contribute.</p>
        
            <p>They will continue to live in the house provided by the Salvation Army until housing becomes available.</p>
        
            <p>"People in this community, they've come over, they've got us things. I'm just amazed by their kindness.</p>
        
            <p>"Some got blankets, some got kitchenware, some got clothes, you know, like everyone was helping out. I'm really grateful."</p>
        
            <p>She said she was lucky her kids were able to start over in a place like Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>"At least here they're they can have their dreams, you know, they can have hope for the future."</p>
        
            <p>Aml knows she's unlikely to return to Gaza, but a piece of it will live on with her in New Zealand</p>
        
            <p>"I actually have my house key until today. I had to close the house. I can't throw it away."</p>
