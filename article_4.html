            <p>Three little blue penguins have died near the construction of a major Wellington cycleway in recent weeks, with one killed by construction machinery.</p>
        
            <p>Te Ara Tupua is a shared pathway which will link up Wellington and Lower Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency has confirmed three little blue penguin have been found dead near the site recently.</p>
        
            <p>Following investigations a bird had been fatally injured by construction machinery on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Two others, one found on 26 April and another on 3 May had deaths not linked to construction works.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi and their contractors are now collating and reviewing findings as an investigation into the incident continues.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA regional manager of infrastructure delivery Jetesh Bhula said conditions and permits were in place to protect the environment during the project's delivery, including the protection of penguins.</p>
        
            <p>In November the developers of the cycleway were issued a formal warning by the Department of Conservation (DOC) after several kororā were killed.</p>
