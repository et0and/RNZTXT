            <p>The beach along Napier's Marine Parade will be cleared of woody debris over the next month following a spate of risky fires.</p>
        
            <p>People had been using the debris left behind by Cyclone Gabrielle as fuel for beach fires, the regional council said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're finding large logs that are charred, and seeing fires being regularly lit in the area which is a fire risk for the beach and community," silt recovery taskforce lead Darren de Klerk said.</p>
        
            <p>The taskforce was leading the clean-up, working with Napier City Council and Fire and Emergency (FENZ).</p>
        
            <p>Contractors would begin stacking and burning wood this week, working along a six-kilometre stretch from Awatoto north, ending at the Foreshore Reserve Freedom Camping Carpark, the council said.</p>
        
            <p>"Any burning will follow FENZ guidance, and if a restricted fire season is put in place, crews will shred the material and cart it offsite," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"Where the wood will be burnt, the team will follow FENZ guidance, and will only burn when the conditions are suitable and wind is blowing away from the shore."</p>
        
            <p>The public was urged not to light open fires this summer, said FENZ Hawke's Bay community risk manager Nigel Hall.</p>
        
            <p>"There is cause for concern with temperatures rising, and our crews are spending a lot of time attending beach fires.</p>
        
            <p>"We need the public to be responsible and vigilant and not set fires that are going to require our attendance.</p>
        
            <p>"In these conditions, fires will spread rapidly, grass and scrub are easily ignited, and fires will be difficult to control."</p>
