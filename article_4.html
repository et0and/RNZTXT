            <p>Santa is deferring his visit to Wellington by a day due to heavy rain and northerlies forecast for the capital on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington City Council is now staging its Christmas event on Sunday, with a range of free activities in Waitangi Park including ice skating, a snow dome, foam pit, crafts and performances.</p>
        
            <p>Santa will touch down in his sleigh at 11am near the Clyde Quay Wharf Marina and head to Waitangi Park, where he will dismount to meet the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>He will then be available for private audiences in his grotto until 5pm.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said Wellington would have "occasional rain, persistent for a time late morning and afternoon" with "strong northerlies". Rain was expected to be heaviest around 10am.</p>
        
            <p>It was also expected to rain on Sunday, however, according to the forecasters' website.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain watch was in place for the Tararua Range, north of the city, from 4am Saturday until early Sunday morning.</p>
