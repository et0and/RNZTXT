            <p>A medical aid ship stuck in Fiji will return to New Zealand after fundraising $200,000.</p>
        
            <p>The ship, from the organisation Youth with a Mission (YWAM), was providing medical aid in isolated communities in Fiji when an issue with a bearing in the tailshaft left the group with a $300,000 bill.</p>
        
            <p>It managed to pay a third of it, with the rest being donated by New Zealanders and the South Waikato trust Trinity Lands.</p>
        
            <p>YWAM ships managing director Marty Emmett said he was "blown away" by the support.</p>
        
            <p>"We're just buzzing... It actually makes us emotional to know there are people who care about reaching our Pacific neighbours with medical aid.</p>
        
            <p>"To everyone who donated: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please be a part of our family and sign up for updates so you can see what your help will achieve this next season."</p>
        
            <p>The YWAM Koha was originally built in 1968 in Germany as a buoy tender, and was used as a ferry between NZ and Pitcairn Island before being gifted to YWAM Ships NZ in 2019 - hence the name 'Koha'.</p>
        
            <p>The 48m-long ship, normally based in Tauranga, was fitted with two dental clinics and equipment to set up pop-up clinics on land.</p>
        
            <p>Emmett said during Covid-19 while borders were closed, YWAM ships offered a free dental clinic in New Zealand communities experiencing poverty, providing dental care to more than 3000 people.</p>
        
            <p>"People tell us, 'I can eat now. I can sleep now. I can go get a job now and get off the benefit. I have my confidence restored.' But the greatest thing we hear is, 'I can smile again'.</p>
        
            <p>"We're seeing people smiling at each other again, including communities that have had generations of gang involvement.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we're best as Kiwis when we're looking after our communities and neighbours in need."</p>
        
            <p>He said the ship would be back in New Zealand by Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"We'll now be able to get our ship repaired and back home by Christmas, so we can avoid cyclone season, restock and head back to our friends in the Pacific in May."</p>
