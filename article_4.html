            <p>Nelson City Council has sold nine homes from slip-prone properties in The Brook, with the first of them to be removed at the end of this year.</p>
        
            <p>In April, the council spent $6.7 million buying 10 properties, after investigations following the August 2022 storm showed ongoing slope failures during heavy rain were likely and the landslide risk was higher than previously thought.</p>
        
            <p>The council had planned to remediate slips in The Brook which originated from public land, until further rain last year meant they had become more widespread and unstable.</p>

            <p>Acting group manager infrastructure David Light said all but one of the homes had sold for a total of $76,000.</p>
        
            <p>"We are pleased that the homes were able to be sold quickly and efficiently. Our primary concern was to address the safety issues and ensure the homes were relocated in a timely manner, and we hope that these homes provide new opportunities for their new owners."</p>
        
            <p>With the latest settlement date in August, all of the homes are expected to be moved to their new locations between December and February.</p>
        
            <p>One home in Brook Street remains on the market and if it doesn't sell, a decision on demolition, at a cost of about $100,000, will be made in August.</p>
        
            <p>Light said the money from the sale of the homes would go toward the cost of desconstructing the remaining building, or remediating the land if funds allowed.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Nick Smith has said the council does not intend to allow building on the land again.</p>
        
            <p>Once the buildings were removed, a bund with stormwater controls would be installed below the properties to protect council services, the road, and properties across the street.</p>
        
            <p>The land would then be planted out and would potentially become part of the Tantragee Reserve.</p>
