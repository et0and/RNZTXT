            <p>A man has been arrested after five properties were burgled in one street in one night, police say.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, residents on Princess Street in the Auckland suburb of Takanini reported that jewellery and tools had been stolen from them, Counties Manukau South commander Joe Hunter said.</p>
        
            <p>"We received five reports from victims all along the same stretch of road."</p>
        
            <p>Some of the properties targeted had a shared a driveway.</p>
        
            <p>"Our staff were very quick to identify the offender via CCTV footage, which was provided by the victims," Hunter said.</p>
        
            <p>A 30-year-old man was charged with burglary and unlawful interference and was schedule to reappear in Manukau District Court on 22 January.</p>
        
            <p>Hunter said the incident was a reminder to lock doors and windows, to be vigilant and to report suspicious activity to 111 as it happens, or by calling 105 after it happens.</p>
