            <p>Transport inequities are proving a barrier for some young people in Invercargill, preventing them from joining in group activities.</p>
        
            <p>The issue was highlighted at an Invercargill City Council infrastructure services committee meeting on Tuesday, where public transport fares were discussed.</p>
        
            <p>During debate, councillor Grant Dermody said he wasn't clear on what the 30 year vision for public transport looked like for the city.</p>
        
            <p>Dermody said the council needed to look at connecting its network to different areas, such as Bluff or Sandy Point.</p>
        
            <p>Council manager strategic asset planning Doug Rodgers agreed there was work to be done.</p>
        
            <p>"I met with community leaders in South City, just regarding that very fact, that young people have difficulties getting to sport on a Saturday because mum and dad basically are transport disadvantaged, they don't have a vehicle," Rodgers said.</p>
        
            <p>"They can't get to sports practice during the week.</p>
        
            <p>"These are things that come into that larger strategic view of what we want to provide, and what we can provide."</p>
        
            <p>The public transport report tabled at Tuesday's meeting was a follow-up to an April report which highlighted a $95,000 hole for the council on the back of a government announcement it would no longer fund free public transport for under 13s, or half price fares for under 25s.</p>
        
            <p>Tuesday's report was requested for by councillors, and provided more information ahead of upcoming long term plan deliberations.</p>
        
            <p>It showed that while patronage was on the rise - around the 150,000 patron-per-annum mark - it had dropped from over 200,000 in 2015/16.</p>
        
            <p>The largest cohort of users were youths and children, with only about 30 percent of patrons classified as adults, Rodgers said.</p>
        
            <p>A range of options were presented to councillors in lieu of the government pulling back on its subsidy, but no decision would be made until the deliberations took place.</p>
        
            <p>Options ranged from providing free fares for all users at a cost of $170,000 to the council, to charging a flat $3 fare for all users over 5 years of age, which would bring in $496,000.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy mayor Tom Campbell requested staff provide a net cost to council for various options, while mana whenua representative Pania Coote expressed her hopes for the bus service to extend to Bluff.</p>
