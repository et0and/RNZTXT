            <p>The drinking water ban in the Horowhenua township of Tokomaru has been lifted, three days after lead was detected in the water supply.</p>
        
            <p>The Horowhenua District Council found the contamination appeared to be from an old tap that is not connected to the wider water network.</p>
        
            <p>But three days of clear test results were required before the ban could be lifted.</p>
        
            <p>"Public Safety is our number one priority and while we may have caused our community concern and inconvenience, it was important that we had complete confidence that the water supply was and still is safe for drinking," the council said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Residents are still advised to run the tap for about 30 seconds before drinking the water.</p>
        
            <p>There will be a public meeting Monday night at 6pm at the Tokomaru Community Hall for anyone who still has questions or concerns.</p>
