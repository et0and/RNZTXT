            <p>Surf Life Saving New Zealand is predicting a busy summer season, thanks to the increased chance of serious weather events and above-average temperatures..</p>
        
            <p>The long weekend sees the start of summer surf life saving patrols along Aotearoa's coastlines.</p>
        
            <p>Surf Life Saving's Chris Emmett said by summer's peak there would be 96 patrolled locations nationwide, and they all relied on an amazing group of volunteers.</p>
        
            <p>They had been at work over the winter keeping up their knowledge and fitness, and they were keen to begin beach patrols again, he said.</p>
        
            <p>But the volunteers needed the public to support them by being aware of risks and making good decisions around water, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Keeping people safe is not something that surf lifeguards can do on their own. We need the public to help their local clubs to ensure everyone stays safe."</p>
        
            <p>Volunteers were "incredibly well prepared, trained and committed to supporting the public", Emmett said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our surf lifeguards across the country are a friendly, approachable presence ... [and] we encourage beachgoers to come and ask us questions, find out about the beach and water conditions for that day, hazards to watch out for, and what the tides are doing.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of our patrolled beaches also have informative signs that display this key information, so we also encourage everyone to look out for these."</p>
        
            <p>This year, Surf Life Saving has released its key beach safety messages in te reo Māori as well as English.</p>
