            <p>Wellington primary school pupils are asking the regional council to establish a marine protected area around Worser Bay Boating Club for at least the next 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>Worser Bay School students have been researching the effects of pollution, climate change and overfishing on marine ecosystems and involved in establishing what's known as 'Blue Belt' sites - or marine conservation areas - as part of the Moanamana programme, launched by Yachting New Zealand last year.</p>
        
            <p>They want to set up a Blue Belt site around the boating club so people do not take fish, shellfish, crustaceans, molluscs, anemones and kelp. But the students are also seeking support to install an aquaculture container and artificial reef structure, as well as a snorkel trail incorporating a series of underwater artworks.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been learning a lot about marine science," Worser Bay School pupil Samuel Peachey told at an Environment Committee meeting on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been researching about the animals and what habitats they live in," pupil Marcia Blackwell said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been down in the rockpools working with people based at the Worser Bay Yacht Club to learn more about the marine life and its importance to us," Peachey added.</p>
        
            <p>"We have also been snorkelling, so that we could also see what lies in the ocean."</p>
        
            <p>"We have been testing the waters of Worser Bay, and have used many types of equipment to help us do this," pupil Alice Nicolson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Moanamana is caring for the ocean, and we are doing exactly that."</p>

            <p>A prototype site as well as ongoing habitat restoration projects, such as a seaweed nursery, p훮ua hatchery, penguin hotel, snorkel trail and anemone garden, was established at Worser Bay Boating Club in Seatoun.</p>
        
            <p>Students from Worser Bay School - and other schools in eastern Wellington - have also been working with scientists from the New Zealand Marine Studies Centre at the University of Otago and Coastal People Southern Skies Centre for Research Excellence to develop and test a toolkit to monitor the Worser Bay site.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Yadana Saw had helped the students to present to the other members of the Environment Committee.</p>
        
            <p>"I think one of the most important things of having the younger members of our community come and speak to us is that I think it helps us remember the commitment we have for intergenerational solutions, and that our work needs to focus on the current citizens and future ratepayers of our region," she said.</p>

            <p>Saw believed the 'Blue Belt' site at Worser Bay was aligned to the kaipupuri taonga ki te ao wh훮nui ('the taonga we stand for everywhere with everyone') framework, developed by the Mauri T큰hono ki te Upoko o te Ika a M훮ui group, and launched by the regional council in November, as well as the Whaitua Implementation Programme.</p>
        
            <p>Greater Wellington Regional Council, along with the Department of Conservation and National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, will meet with the Worser Bay School students again to develop a plan and map out the next steps.</p>
