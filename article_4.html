            <p>Four men are now facing murder charges following the death of Boy Taylor in Napier.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the 58-year-old, who was living on the streets, died after being assaulted last week.</p>
        
            <p>A second victim has also been identified.</p>
        
            <p>The police said all four would now be charged with murder, and would also face an additional charge of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>
        
            <p>Two men appeared in Napier District Court on 23 December and are due to reappear in January.</p>
        
            <p>An 18-year-old man appeared in Wellington District Court on 24 December, while a 19-year-old man was scheduled to appear in Hastings District Court on the same day.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector David de Lange said police were not looking for anyone else in relation to the death of Taylor.</p>
        
            <p>"While we still have more work to do, we hope that these arrests provide the victim's family with some degree of comfort at a very difficult time."</p>
        
            <p>Charges against the four men would be reviewed by police, de Lange said and further charges against them, including murder, could not be ruled out.</p>
