            <p>A border collie's "horrific injuries" have healed six weeks after her throat was "ripped open" by two dogs that came onto her owner's property in the Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>Molly was all smiles and wags, if not a little hot, when Local Democracy Reporting recently caught up with her and her owner Paul Gibbs.</p>
        
            <p>Gibbs said she had her last vet appointment for the injuries on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The 13-year-old dog had a wound on the top of her head that only just closed up in the last couple of days, he said.</p>
        
            <p>On December 4, Molly was relaxing on the grass when two German Shepherds came onto the Whakamārama property after leaping from a ute at a nearby petrol station.</p>
        
            <p>Gibbs said they chased his son's dog up the driveway then came across Molly. He didn't see the attack, but was shocked to find her bleeding from the neck.</p>
        
            <p>At first he thought someone had put a red collar on his dog, then after a closer look realised she was bleeding from "horrifying" gaping wounds and her neck had been "ripped open".</p>
        
            <p>"She literally had stitches from the top of her neck, right around to the bottom."</p>

            <p>Molly required two surgeries and Gibbs estimated she needed at least 50 stitches. She also had daily vet visits to check the wounds.</p>
        
            <p>"She's such a placid dog and for that to happen to her, it was just devastating."</p>
        
            <p>He hadn't received a final vet bill,but the first surgery cost $1500 and the second was $2300.</p>
        
            <p>Gibbs was also bitten on the hand when he tried to stop the owner of the German shepherds leaving his property.</p>
        
            <p>The man came up his driveway to collect his dogs, Gibbs said. Gibbs reached into the man's car to try to stop him leaving and was bitten.</p>
        
            <p>"It was quite painful. I had to go to the doctor to get a tetanus shot and get it treated."</p>
        
            <p>The wound has healed but a red mark remains visible.</p>

            <p>Gibbs flagged down a passing police officer who attempted to stop the driver leaving. He said the police put out road spikes, but the driver avoided them and drove away.</p>
        
            <p>He reported the attack to the Western Bay of Plenty District Council, and he is considering filling an assault charge with police against the dog owner for biting him.</p>
        
            <p>Molly's temperament has returned to normal but she was wary of other dogs during vet visits, said Gibbs.</p>
        
            <p>"She would cower away from me, [which] was horrible to see [as] she's never done that."</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson confirmed an officer assisted after a dog attack at a Whakamārama property and the matter had been referred to animal control.</p>

            <p>Gibbs said he believed the dogs should have been taken off their owner when the attack first happened. He was concerned the dogs could attack another dog or a person.</p>
        
            <p>"I think they [the council] were all a bit blasé about it. I felt like they didn't see the seriousness of it."</p>
        
            <p>Western Bay of Plenty District Council team leader animal services Peter Hrstich said the council was still investigating the incident and there weren't any updates.</p>
        
            <p>"We are aware of a dog attack that took place at a private property in Whakamārama on 4 December.</p>
        
            <p>"It is important that we take the necessary time to gather and compile all the evidence available to us, before coming to a decision."</p>
