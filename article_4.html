            <p>Police have released the name of the person whose remains were found in Porirua in January.</p>
        
            <p>She was Patricia Theresa Burt, who went missing on 4 April 1988.</p>
        
            <p>The human remains were discovered near the Whitireia Park walkway in TÄ«tahi Bay on 31 January 2024.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Detective Senior Sergeant Hamish Blackburn said DNA confirmation from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research, allowed police to confirm the identity of the remains.</p>
        
            <p>There was no evidence to suggest the death was suspicious, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police extended their condolences to Burt's family and Blackburn said they were being provided with support.</p>
        
            <p>The coroner has been notified and the body would be returned to the family in due course, he said.</p>
