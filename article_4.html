            <p>The government has proposed a major shift in name suppression laws that would put a stop to secrecy around the identities of sex offenders.</p>
        
            <p>It wants survivors - not judges - to have the power to decide whether or not convicted sex offenders get permanent name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>It comes as a former political figure, who is not a sitting MP, is about to be sentenced for sexually abusing two teenage boys in the late 1990s.</p>
        
            <p>His name has been kept secret on an interim basis for 667 days and he is expected to ask the court for permanent name suppression on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>One of the man's victims, Nathan*, will be there. He told RNZ that it was painful the offender's name suppression was still stopping him from openly talking about what happened.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of shame, a lot of pain ... not being able to speak the truth or freely discuss what's affected me and my life experiences isolates me.</p>
        
            <p>"It makes me feel quite distanced from my community and society."</p>
        
            <p>Helen*, the mother of the offender's other victim, said the secrecy around the man's identity had destroyed lives.</p>
        
            <p>"We know what it's doing to his victims and he's walking around in public. That is just so wrong, it's so wrong.</p>
        
            <p>"How can a person who's been found guilty in a court of law in our country be allowed to do this? It's just unbelievable."</p>
        
            <p>The government's proposed law change would give survivors like Nathan the power to make a call on permanent name suppression, rather than a judge.</p>
        
            <p>While this would not apply retrospectively, he said it was a great move.</p>
        
            <p>"I was quite blown away to be honest ... immensely relieved survivors can speak to their truth and the perpetrators will be named.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just ... relieving is really the best I can do. Just like a weight's shifted."</p>
        
            <p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith said he could not speak to specific cases, but he had heard firsthand just how damaging protracted legal battles for secrecy could be.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not basing this on any particular case but it's a frequent occurrence and it has a horrendous impact on the victims of this time because ultimately they're muffled in what they can say."</p>
        
            <p>He believed the public had a right to know who had been convicted of sexual crimes, and said there had been an estimated 70 permanent name suppression orders granted in 2023 alone.</p>
        
            <p>"It's gone too far in in practice and I think we need to tighten it up and really give some power to the victims."</p>
        
            <p>Victims' advocate Ruth Money said it was welcome news, and she had been swamped with correspondence from survivors.</p>
        
            <p>"They are so relieved. They feel heard, finally.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm absolutely thrilled for this change. For far too many years, victims have felt gagged and like they're the ones that have been suppressed. So this finally gives them a voice in these decisions."</p>
        
            <p>But the Criminal Bar Association does not support the proposed changes.</p>
        
            <p>Its vice-president Sumudu Thode said judges already took a victim's views into account and were best placed to make such decisions.</p>
        
            <p>"A judge has the benefit of knowing why [defendants] are seeking name suppression and what evidence there is to support their submission as to why they should get name suppression.</p>
        
            <p>'They have the legal background and expertise to be able to apply the law in a logical way."</p>
        
            <p>Thode also raised concerns about the possible impact on appeal rights.</p>
        
            <p>"For us to appeal a decision it has to be either because the decision-maker got something wrong in fact or in law.</p>
        
            <p>"If all you get is a 'yes or a no' without a reasoned decision, then appealing that is difficult."</p>
        
            <p>The final form of the legislation is yet to take shape, with the bill still before a select committee.</p>
        
            <p>The justice minister's office has confirmed the law change would apply to any crimes of a sexual nature.</p>
        
            <p>*Nathan and Helen's names have been anonymised so as not to breach automatic name suppression for victims of sexual crimes.</p>
