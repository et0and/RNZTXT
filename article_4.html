            <p>The rain fell like tears in Nelson on Friday night as a vigil was held for the first New Zealand policewoman killed in the line of duty.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming was killed after being hit by a vehicle in Buxton Square in the early hours of New Year's Day.</p>
        
            <p>A 32-year-old man has been charged with her murder.</p>
        
            <p>The weather did not deter people from gathering to commemorate Fleming. A sea of umbrellas could be seen from above as about 2000 people congregated, wearing different shades of blue.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the weather here tonight is indicative of the way we all feel," Nelson Bays Area Commander Steve Collins said as he addressed the crowd.</p>

            <p>"This is not, by any means, an obituary for Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming, who deserves and will receive a far better send-off than I could ever provide, but it is important to publicly recognise the irreplaceable hole that her [death] has left within the Nelson Police and the wider community.</p>
        
            <p>"Lyn was a cornerstone of the Nelson Police. She is frankly irreplaceable.</p>
        
            <p>"She was experienced, dedicated, intelligent, genuine, a genuine matriarch of a police leader.</p>
        
            <p>"She was great with people, well-mannered, respectful, well-respected throughout the Nelson Police and the community.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>"She nurtured, was protective of everyone and fiercely loyal of her staff.</p>
        
            <p>"She was a close colleague, someone I consider a friend, and someone I could trust.</p>
        
            <p>"She touched many, many lives, and the world is undoubtedly a poorer place without her."</p>
        
            <p>A large group of uniformed police joined the vigil, and were cheered by the crowd as bagpipes played. Fleming's family stood behind them.</p>

            <p>Nelson MP Rachel Boyack said the large turnout, despite the rain, showed the depth of the loss the community was feeling.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman mayor Tim King said organiser Shelley Bishop had told him the police worked in all weather conditions, and it was not too much of a hardship to come out and show some solidarity.</p>
        
            <p>For those who could not attend, Bishop had asked them to tie blue ribbons or balloons to their mailbox instead.</p>
        
            <p>Andrea Warn and her daughter Bianca had made a bouquet of blue and white flowers, and tied blue ribbons and balloons onto her street sign in The Brook.</p>

            <p>In a post on Facebook, the Nelson College for Girls Sport page said Fleming was the "bedrock of our netball programme for over a decade".</p>
        
            <p>"Words can not describe her impact on our athletes, coaches and staff at Nelson College for Girls."</p>
        
            <p>Warn and her daughter had also collected donations for Nelson College for Girls in lieu of flowers for Fleming.</p>
        
            <p>"Lyn fundraised tirelessly for the College Girls sports, and when it fell short, [she] would top it up herself," she said.</p>

            <p>Bishop had also asked for flowers to be taken to the Nelson Police Station. There were hundreds already at the base of the flagpole, where the New Zealand Police flag remained at half-mast.</p>
        
            <p>Warn told RNZ that Nelson Police had also helped her rescue a cat stuck in a nearby culvert on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>"The officer shimmied down, and we ran home and got our cat cage and towel, and he waded through the water and collected the frail kitty. They took her to the local vet, and then returned my cat cage to my house.</p>
        
            <p>"How they could come to work and perform their duties after what happened?</p>
        
            <p>"I gave one of the big, burly chaps a rub on the shoulder and thanked them for their effort today and the work they do every day.</p>

            <p>"They could see my teary face and were welling up as well."</p>
        
            <p>When Warn had posted about it on Facebook, the partner of one of the officers, Samila Chisnall, replied that he was "really moved" by her kind touch and sincere thanks.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately life doesn't stop during these horrific circumstances, but the love felt from the community is so priceless," Chisnall wrote.</p>
        
            <p>During the vigil, Collins said that he was "genuinely proud" of the Nelson Police.</p>
        
            <p>"The last few days have felt almost impossible, and yet I ask for more as I ask you to do your job professionally without fear or favour while you carry this grief."</p>

            <p>As the crowd chanted "thank you for your service" and "kia kaha", Collins continued by asking the community to keep Fleming in their hearts.</p>
        
            <p>"For today Nelson, and ongoing, remember Lyn Fleming.</p>
        
            <p>"For today be proud of your police but notice the slump in our shoulders, the twinkle in our eyes is gone, the faces are more drawn, our eyes are more weary, part of us is missing. Lyn Fleming was that part.</p>
        
            <p>"We grieve. Nelson, you grieve with us."</p>
