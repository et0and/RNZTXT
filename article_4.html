            <p>Nearly three million pieces of online material showing child sexual abuse and terrorism were seized in investigations into digital child exploitation last year.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Internal Affairs undertook 47 investigations into digital child exploitation in 2023, uncovering 2,966,773 pieces of online material.</p>
        
            <p>The level of content being shared was "extremely worrying", digital child exploitation team manager Tim Housten said.</p>
        
            <p>The online material seized by the DIA included videos and images of "horrific" child sexual abuse, as well as violent extremist content and objectionable adult content.</p>
        
            <p>"The content we are seizing and prosecuting against is not innocent pictures of children, it is serious and abhorrent sexual abuse of children," Housten said.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to the materials, investigators also seized 209 devices and successfully prosecuted 15 offenders last year.</p>
        
            <p>The rest of the alleged offenders were still going through the legal process.</p>
        
            <p>More than one million websites harbouring child sexual abuse materials were blocked by a filtering system.</p>
        
            <p>Housten said that the material sized included AI-generated images and videos, showing that exploitative material generated by AI was on the rise.</p>
        
            <p>"AI-generated content is becoming easier to create, which normalises and encourages the physical abuse of children," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It takes significant resource and time to determine whether a child is AI-generated or not and takes our investigators away from identifying real-world children who are at risk."</p>
        
            <p>Internationally, reports of online child sexual exploitation were also increasing.</p>
        
            <p>The DIA reported referrals to New Zealand from the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in the United States increased by 283% from 2021-2023 compared to 2018-2020.</p>
        
            <p>Over the year, the agency worked with Police, Customs and Oranga Tamariki to safeguard 35 children from harm or risk of harm from an offender, Housten said.</p>
        
            <p>"The strong partnerships we have with other agencies in NZ Police, Customs and Oranga Tamariki has been critical in taking children out of potentially harmful environments."</p>
