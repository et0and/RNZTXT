            <p>Wellington police have arrested a man for aggravated robbery after a crypto currency deal made over the social media platform Discord.</p>
        
            <p>The 32-year-old is set to appear in the Wellington District Court on Saturday on two charges of aggravated robbery after a search warrant at Hopper Street on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The two robberies happened in broad daylight at New World car parks in Newlands on 29 February, and at Chaffers on 5 March.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Tim Leitch said police were still looking to speak with two men who may be able to help the enquiry.</p>
        
            <p>"The robberies have been very upsetting for the victims, as they were committed in busy public places in broad daylight," Leitch said in a statement.</p>
