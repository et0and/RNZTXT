            <p>Another 50 New Zealanders who were on holiday in New Caledonia when riots started are on their way home.</p>
        
            <p>A third evacuation flight from Nouméa took off at around 11.45am and is expected to arrive in Auckland by mid-afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Andre Capiez was one of the passengers invited on board the Hercules plane at Magenta Airport.</p>
        
            <p>"I got a phone call yesterday afternoon telling me that I would be on the flight and had to make it to a rendezvous point this morning... at 7am outside one of the tourist hotels," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I had a friend drive me there and then we had to register, fill in a medical form, set our baggage aside and then we had a briefing about the plane."</p>
        
            <p>Capiez had been staying in southern Nouméa, which he said was fairly removed from rioting in the northern suburbs.</p>
        
            <p>"Most [other passengers] feel okay because the tourist areas have been fairly safe," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But on their way from the rendezvous to Magenta Airport, the group "went the long way around the bays to stay in those southern suburbs".</p>
        
            <p>He said the airport was heavily guarded.</p>
        
            <p>"We are at the domestic airport in the local flying club area, not the commercial side of the airport. There are French armed forces around so it's very secure."</p>
        
            <p>Overall, Capiez said the evacuation process had been very smooth.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been really good because the consular staff, NZDF people, MFAT people have all been very amazing," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"They walked us through what to expect, that we should arrive in Auckland mid-afternoon. Staff were seeing if they could re-book [flights] for people who need to fly elsewhere in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Defence Force staff had distributed earplugs and warned passengers that the flight would be noisy, but many were just happy to go home, Capiez said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a number of people here with young children and babies, so it's going to be a big relief for people to get home."</p>
