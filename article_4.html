            <p>Whangārei becomes the latest district council to decide the future of its Māori wards when councillors vote on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>A rally by supporters of Māori wards will be held outside the council offices.</p>
        
            <p>A new law which came into effect last month requires all councils to decide, by 6 September, between abolishing their Māori wards or holding a binding poll alongside next year's local body elections.</p>
        
            <p>At Thursday's meeting, councillors will be asked to choose between three options.</p>
        
            <p>They can opt to keep the Whangarei District Māori ward for the 2025-28 term and hold a binding poll alongside next year's local election to determine whether Māori wards will continue in 2028 and 2031.</p>
        
            <p>Alternatively, they can choose to abolish the Māori ward from 2025 and either revert to the wards used in the 2019 election, or carry out a shortened representation review to adjust ward boundaries and councillor numbers for the next election.</p>
        
            <p>Whangārei District Council currently has two Māori ward councillors, Phoenix Ruka and Deb Harding, elected at large across the district.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, the Northland Regional Council voted eight to one to retain its two-seat Te Raki Māori ward, and six to three to seek advice on the consequences of not holding a poll at the 2025 elections.</p>
        
            <p>During a fiery meeting earlier this month, Kaipara District Council voted 6 to 3 to disestablish its Te Moananui o Kaipara Māori ward, currently held by councillor Pera Paniora.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first council in the country to use the new law to abolish a Māori ward from 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Kaipara's decision is, however, being challenged by Ngāti Whatua, which has requested a judicial review on the grounds the council did not meet its consultation obligations prior to the vote.</p>
        
            <p>Far North District councillors have already indicated they intend to retain the four-seat Ngā Tai o Tokerau Māori Ward.</p>
        
            <p>They are due to hold a formal vote on 5 September.</p>
        
            <p>Northland was the first region in New Zealand to establish Māori wards across all its councils, after a 2021 law change removed the requirement for a binding poll on Māori wards if requested by 5 percent of electors.</p>
        
            <p>That law change has now been reversed.</p>
