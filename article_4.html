        <h2>No congestion charging for Nelson, yet</h2>
        <p>
Regional leaders don't currently see a place for time-of-use charging in Nelson Tasman, but add that it shouldn't be ruled out in the face of future population growth.

            <p>Congestion charging could soon be coming to New Zealand streets, but it's not on the cards for Nelson Tasman, not yet anyway.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the government announced that it plans to introduce new legislation allowing councils to introduce time-of-use charges later this year.</p>
        
            <p>Time-of-use charging would see motorists pay a fee to drive on the busiest streets and during the busiest times.</p>
        
            <p>Drivers could avoid the fee by travelling on another route, by other means such as on the bus, or at a different time, which would see fewer vehicles on the road at peak times.</p>
        
            <p>If you're unlucky enough to join traffic at the wrong time during peak hours, a journey of about 14 kilometres between Richmond and central Nelson can take 45 minutes or more.</p>
        
            <p>However, the region's leaders say despite the challenging rush hours, it's not something that Nelson Tasman should adopt just yet.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not sure that we quite ready for it yet because peak congestion is only a relatively short time a day," said Tasman's deputy mayor Stuart Bryant.</p>
        
            <p>"If we were having people waiting in queues like they do in Auckland for an hour, that would be a whole different kettle of fish. But currently, I can't see people be very sympathetic to that at all."</p>
        
            <p>
Regional transport committee chair Stuart Bryant said that time-of-use charging shouldn't be ruled out in the face of significant future population growth.

            <p>Bryant, who is also the chair of the joint transport committee, suggested that the region should focus on other measures to take the pressure off the roading network.</p>
        
            <p>He highlighted eBus service, which has doubled the patronage numbers of its predecessor, and has been a long-time advocate of transit lanes in some "strategic point".</p>
        
            <p>But the Hope Bypass, a Road of National Significance that would add capacity to the local road network, isn't slated to begin construction until at least 2030.</p>
        
            <p>And with the Nelson-Richmond area predicted to grow by about 15,000 over the next 25-30 years, Bryant doesn't think time-of-use charging should be ruled out for the future.</p>
        
            <p>"As the population is growing and it becomes more and more of an issue ... then that's when it could come into play."</p>
        
            <p>Nelson Mayor Nick Smith is of a similar mind.</p>
        
            <p>"Nobody's going to potentially rule it out."</p>
        
            <p>However, he pointed out that time-of-use charging is being introduced for centres like Auckland and that it's used in other major cities around the world like Dubai, Seoul, Singapore, and Stockholm.</p>
        
            <p>"These multi-million-people cities are quite different to the sorts of challenges that Nelson has."</p>
        
            <p>Smith said neither the regional transport committee nor the Nelson council have discussed whether they would want to enact time-of-use charging, and that he would need to see the detail of the legislation before deciding.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it's less likely for a community like ours."</p>
        
            <p>His interest was in seeing how time-of-use charging would interact with road-user and fuel excise taxes as technology develops in the future.</p>
        
            <p>
Nelson Mayor Nick Smith said time-of-use charging was more appropriate for major cities rather than regional centres like Nelson.

            <p>Minister of Transport Simeon Brown said congestion was a "tax on time and productivity" in a statement announcing the legislation last week.</p>
        
            <p>"Faster, more reliable travel times will increase productivity, and lower costs for businesses and their customers. That is why we are enabling time of use schemes to be put in place."</p>
        
            <p>Money raised from time-of-use charging would be reinvested into transport infrastructure.</p>
