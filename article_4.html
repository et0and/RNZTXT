            <p>The mother of a missing Tauranga doctor has made a heart-felt plea for information, two years since his disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>Thirty-one-year-old David Holland, an anaesthetics registrar at Tauranga Hospital, disappeared on the evening of 11 March, 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Holland was last seen at his Papamoa Beach home with police issuing CCTV footage of the man a year ago.</p>
        
            <p>When he failed to turn up for work, friends and family expressed concern for Holland, sparking a police 'missing person' inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>Initially, it was believed Holland had intended to go for a swim at the beach near the end of Pacific View Road.</p>
        
            <p>Despite a number of lines of investigation over the past two years, his whereabouts remain unknown.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, police issued a statement on behalf of Holland's mother, Karen.</p>
        
            <p>Karen said after two years of no developments, she and her family desperately wanted answers.</p>
        
            <p>"We still have no news. Nothing. Just speculation. A nightmare. We want to wake up."</p>

            <p>Originally from Swansea in Wales, Holland had been living in New Zealand since 2017 and applied for his reisdency prior to his disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>"This came as a complete shock," his mother said.</p>
        
            <p>"Life changed forever when I took the late night call from New Zealand telling me that there was concern about his safety."</p>
        
            <p>She said if anyone with any information potentially linked to her son's disappearance or knows his current whereabouts or know someone that may have been, to contact police.</p>
        
            <p>"Initially thought to have been lost at sea whilst swimming, despite being a strong swimmer, later CCTV footage of someone that could possibly have been David, walking towards a state highway, led to other theories developing and hence, no closure."</p>
        
            <p>She described her youngest son as "clever, multi-talented, sporty, caring, kind, thoughtful".</p>
        
            <p>"Such a beautiful human being, David is much missed by family and friends in New Zealand and the UK.</p>
        
            <p>"Having visited David several times in New Zealand, the country will always be special to me. I'm hoping for help from communities all over the country at this sensitive, emotional time."</p>

            <p>The mother extended her appeal directly to her missing son.</p>
        
            <p>"Please come back to us. You are my waking thought, my last thought at night. Dealing with ambiguous loss, grieving, looking for answers is part of my life.</p>
        
            <p>"Grief doesn't go away and can be incredibly lonely. No parent chooses this road. Our relationship was so close. The memories that we have of David are so precious.</p>
        
            <p>"We remember and cherish a very special person and just want you back with us. We still have hope. And always will. David is very much alive in our hearts and minds.</p>
        
            <p>"We love you."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information about the disappearance of Holland can contact police, quoting file number 220312/6869.</p>
