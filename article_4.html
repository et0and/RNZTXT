            <p>Despite 50 years in the business, soul legend Chaka Khan's voice is as strong as ever, she says.</p>
        
            <p>The ten-time Grammy winner is coming to Auckland for a one-off show next month.</p>
        
            <p>Khan has recorded more than 2000 songs during her 50-year career, including 'I'm Every Woman', 'Ain't Nobody' and 'I Feel For You'.</p>
        
            <p>She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023 and her musical collaborations read like a who's who of 20th century music, indeed two of her biggest hits were written by Stevie Wonder and Prince.</p>
        
            <p>Both relationships got off to slightly shaky starts, she tells RNZ's Sunday Morning.</p>
        
            <p>When Khan was in the band Rufus, Wonder was in the studio pitching songs.</p>
        
            <p>"What else have you got?" she asked the songwriting genius.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm totally business, when I go in to record, some people thought I was being rude, but I wasn't being rude. He played a song or two that I thought were just, you know, a little regular."</p>
        
            <p>Eventually Rufus recorded the Wonder-written 'Tell Me Something Good,' a Grammy-winning smash in 1974.</p>
        
            <p>"I love him dearly, we're talking about getting together to do some stuff in the near future as well."</p>
        
            <p>Prince, meanwhile, used subterfuge to lure her to the studio when he was at the start of his recording career, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I was in San Francisco, with a friend hanging out, and we were club hopping and carrying on. And no one had my phone number, but somehow he knew that Sly Stone and I were great friends, and I got a phone call and I picked it up as if it was a family emergency or something, because the phone never rang, and it sounded like Sly Stone. He sounded exactly like Sly.</p>
        
            <p>"I thought I was talking to Sly for a minute, and he said he was in the studio Electric Lady land, or something like that. And I said, oh, I'll be right. I'm coming down."</p>
        
            <p>When she got there, it was just Prince beavering away in the studio, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Not initially impressed, the relationship however improved and yielded her another massive hit, the Prince-penned 'I Feel For You'.</p>
        
            <p>"We got to it, you know, a little bit, but often the greatest friendships, come after a little bit of turmoil.</p>
        
            <p>"We had a tumultuous start, but we ironed it out, and we became great friends."</p>
        
            <p>Khan has had her struggles with substance abuse in the past and said life on the road was hard, especially when she was younger and raising children.</p>
        
            <p>"It's hard, it's very hard. I had two children, toddlers, one toddler, one, maybe four or five, they used to climb into my suitcases when I was packing.</p>
        
            <p>"That's heartbreaking, it's heart wrenching."</p>
        
            <p>Khan is now happily settled in rural Georgia, where she has land in a beautiful part of the state - but it she has no plans to put up her performing shoes just yet.</p>
        
            <p>"Now I just have to just tweak it all and figure out how to be here in Georgia where I am, and to go out and work and not to just kill myself, because I'm not a spring chicken anymore.</p>
        
            <p>"I just do the best I can. I'm doing pretty well. My voice is the same. I'm thankful about that. It hasn't changed."</p>
        
            <p>She's in a good place, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just in a good place, both mentally, spiritually and musically."</p>
        
            <p>Chaka Khan performs at the Civic Theatre, Auckland on 16 April.</p>
