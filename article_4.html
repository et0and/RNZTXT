            <p>A search and rescue operation has been ramped up for a crew member who fell off a commercial fishing vessel in the Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>The man was reported overboard at about 8pm on Monday and a mayday was issued, prompting other vessels in the area to join in the search.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the fishing vessel was 11km offshore from Waimārama.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime NZ's rescue coordination centre was coordinating the multi-agency search and rescue operation which involved rescue helicopters from Auckland, Gisborne and Hastings and the New Zealand Defence Force.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland Westpac Rescue Helicopter joined the search late on Monday but was unsuccessful and has returned back to base on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>A Royal New Zealand Air Force NH90 helicopter was assisting with the search.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay deputy harbour master Adrian Wright told Morning Report the commercial vessel, which is local to the area, had been undergoing its usual operations when the crew member went missing.</p>
        
            <p>"The sea conditions [at the time] weren't actually that bad. It was just one of those situations where something really unfortunate happened," Wright said.</p>
        
            <p>"The visibility was also fairly good, so responders on the scene were able to have pretty good visibility last night into today."</p>

            <p>It was not clear how the man fell overboard or whether he was wearing a life jacket but the rest of the crew had a "pretty good time window" of when the individual went missing, said Wright.</p>
        
            <p>"Essentially when someone falls overboard, what you want to do is try and find the most probable position and use a variety of different forms of information such as wind speed, weather, sea state, where the person is alleged to have fallen overboard, the time, distance," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So you make a few calculations [and] start the search area based on that."</p>
