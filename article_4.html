        <h2>'Excessive' road cone use sparks cost concerns</h2>
        <p>
Farmer Ray Logan has had enough of what he describes as the "over-the-top" use of road cones.

            <p>Mid Canterbury farmer Ray Logan says he is fed up with the "over-the-top" use of road cones.</p>
        
            <p>Driving past road works at the Ashburton Domain, where a new replacement kerb and channel was being installed, he said he could not understand why the road cones stretched the entire length of the worksite "almost touching each other".</p>
        
            <p>"It's just excessive, and I see it as having no respect for the ratepayer's money," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's already fenced on both sides, so really you only need a few dozen cones as the fence is the barricade but then you have this long line of I don't know how many road cones.</p>
        
            <p>"The number of cones is completely unnecessary."</p>

            <p>He said he had no problems with the work being done, as the kerb and channel needed replacing, and the health and safety aspects were part of that - "but it needs to be within reason".</p>
        
            <p>Roading contractors were wasting too much money on over-the-top safety measures, especially road cones, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It certainly needs to be looked at."</p>
        
            <p>Ashburton District Council contractors had been renewing the kerb and channel on Walnut Avenue, between Oak Grove and West Street/SH1 since 20 May.</p>
        
            <p>Council infrastructure and open spaces group manager Neil McCann said the project costs of $180,000 included around $4000 (2.2 percent) for cones, fencing and temporary pedestrian crossings.</p>
        
            <p>"Given that this work involves large heavy machinery, an open trench, and is also well used by Ashburton College, domain users and a rest home, the thorough safety measures to protect the public and the construction are appropriate and necessary."</p>
        
            <p>The work was being carried out in three segments, starting at the Oak Grove end in late May.</p>
        
            <p>The new kerb and channel were not as deep as the old one, but would be higher than a standard kerb to make it difficult for vehicles to be able to drive up onto the Ashburton Domain, McCann said.</p>
        
            <p>Logan's observations came after Transport Minister Simeon Brown put NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi on notice over the cost of its traffic management.</p>
        
            <p>Brown told a Budget scrutiny select committee last month it was "unacceptable" that NZTA did not know the costs of what was spent on temporary traffic management.</p>
        
            <p>On top of making NZTA start to measure the costs from September, a new, less prescriptive code was coming in that should be more efficient, he told MPs.</p>
        
            <p>"I've received advice that in some cases where traffic management's been proscribed, it's actually more dangerous putting out the road cones than it is actually doing the work," Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"So we actually just have to take a 'safety at a reasonable cost' approach, rather than a 'safety at any cost' approach."</p>
        
            <p>A recent Waka Kotahi study found at many sites, road cones were being left out unnecessarily, frustrating motorists, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been an infestation."</p>
