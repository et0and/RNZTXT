            <p>More than 30 firefighters and three helicopters continue to battle the vegetation fire on Matakana Island.</p>
        
            <p>Crews worked overnight to create firebreaks to hold back the blaze that's burnt through about 37 hectares of scrub and pine slash, Fire and Emergency's District Commander Jeff Maunder said.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was a long and arduous task dealing with deep-seated shrub fires, but the fire was completely contained by midday on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The fire, which broke out on Saturday night, sent plumes of black smoke over the skyline in western Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>Bay of Plenty locals are posting to social media with pictures of the fire and smoke which were visible from nearby Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>Resident Leanne Swinburne witnessed the blaze at its brightest..</p>
        
            <p>"You could clearly just see this big, raging, orange fire on the island."</p>
        
            <p>"You could just see big black clouds of smoke."</p>
        
            <p>She said nearby cars were covered in ash and some locals were getting respiratory issues.</p>
        
            <p>Helicopters with monsoon buckets, heavy machinery and fire crews were still at the scene on Monday morning. Drones are due to fly over on Monday night to check for hotspots.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ was alerted to the blaze about 7.30pm on Saturday and sent several crews to the island.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said no houses were at risk.</p>
        
            <p>Civil Defence said there have been no evacuations so far.</p>
        
            <p>The district's mayor, James Denyer, said the fire was very worrying. However, he was confident fire crews would be able to get the blaze under control.</p>
        
            <p>"I was just devastated that such a thing could happen. Any fire on Matakana is serious and has the potential to have far-reaching consequences."</p>
        
            <p>Denyer said he was concerned about further bushfires as the region got drier over summer.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga Commissioner Shadrach Rolleston said he could see the glow of the fire from his house.</p>
        
            <p>He said a family member told him the community had offered food and support to fire crews staying overnight on the island.</p>
        
            <p>Matakana Island was prone to bushfires in summer because it was so dry, Rolleston told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>Late Saturday night, shift manager Garreth Lewis described the fire as about 300 metres by 300 metres, and "very visible from the mainland".</p>
        
            <p>The island has a small resident population and people are being asked to stay away from the fire.</p>
