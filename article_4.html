            <p>The truck driver, 58-year-old Cliff Tamou, from Wigan, who was out of the truck as it had broken down, died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The car driver who was taken to hospital leg and facial injuries has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.</p>
        
            <p>Tamou's family are being supported by specialist police officers.</p>
        
            <p>The family said in a statement: "Cliff Tamou, 58, who moved to the UK over 30 years ago from New Zealand and settled in the Wigan area, was a devoted husband, father to six children and five grandchildren.</p>
        
            <p>"He was a lorry driver for many years and loved playing, refereeing and coaching rugby."</p>
