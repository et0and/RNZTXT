            <p>IHC has confirmed the death of disability rights advocate Sir Robert Martin KNZM, in Whanganui.</p>
        
            <p>In 2008, he became a Member of the NZ Order of Merit and in 2020 a Knight Companion of the NZ Order of Merit for services to people with disabilities.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Robert had told RNZ he was both proud and humbled to receive a knighthood for services to people with disabilities.</p>
        
            <p>He was the first New Zealander with an intellectual disability to be knighted and had served on the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities since 2017. His election was historical with him being the first person with a learning disability elected to the United Nations Treaty Body.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Robert also held roles with Inclusion International and was national self advocacy advisor and trainer for IHC New Zealand between 1991 and 2010.</p>
        
            <p>His early years were spent in institutional care.</p>
        
            <p>Sir Robert is survived by his wife Lynda.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Disabilities Issues Minister Louise Upston paid tribute to Sir Robert, saying New Zealand had lost a true legend.</p>
        
            <p>"Our government's thoughts are with his wife Lynda, family and community, those he has worked with, the disability community in New Zealand, and the disability community internationally," Upston said.</p>
        
            <p>"As the new Minister for Disability Issues, I did not have the chance to work with Sir Robert, but I am familiar with his advocacy for disability rights and that former ministers worked to support his election to the United Nations Committee. It was a proud moment for New Zealand when he was elected to this important role. I join former ministers in offering condolences," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Many disabled people in New Zealand and internationally are living better lives because of Sir Robert's achievements and commitment, and they will be mourning his passing while celebrating his legacy."</p>
        
            <p>IHC chief executive Ralph Jones said his contribution to the community was unequalled.</p>
        
            <p>"I have known Sir Robert for many years and his achievements were remarkable. We served together for many years on the Council of Inclusion International.</p>
        
            <p>"He made a real difference to the lives of people with disabilities both in New Zealand and overseas. It's an incredible legacy."</p>
        
            <p>In a post to Facebook, People First New Zealand Ngā Tāngata Tuatahi said Sir Robert's legacy would continue with his advocacy for disability rights and deinstitutionalisation, nationally and internationally.</p>
        
            <p>"We know Sir Robert's passing will come as a shock to many, especially to our People First members. During this time, it is important to share your grief and feelings with your family, friends and support networks. Our Regional Coordinators are also here if you need someone to talk to."</p>
        
            <p>Sir Robert was also noted for his work towards people with disabilities living in the community and supported decision making.</p>
        
            <p>People First NZ national committee chairperson Ronnie Sione said Sir Robert was one of the first members of the organisation and led by example.</p>
        
            <p>"People First members and people with learning disability in New Zealand and around the world have sadly lost their leader."</p>
        
            <p>Sir Robert was a lifetime member and told RNZ in 2019 he wanted a leader that looked and sounded like him, and when there was not one, he decided to fill the gap.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why I fought tooth and nail for the likes of People First, the only organisation in New Zealand that speaks for, and on behalf of people with learning disabilities."</p>
        
            <p>YES Disability Resource Centre said on Facebook Sir Robert was "an incredible advocate, mentor and role model to many".</p>
        
            <p>"We will be forever grateful and always remember his generosity of time and sharing of his story to change the world for others.</p>
        
            <p>"Our love and prayers to his family."</p>
        
            <p>Disability Rights Commissioner Prudence Walker said Sir Robert devoted his life to disability rights after living in institutions in his younger years, and spoke of his childhood experiences while giving evidence in the abuse in care inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>"Sir Robert played a critical role in Aotearoa and internationally in upholding disabled people's right to be part of the community, and to contribute to society," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>"Kei tēnā, kei tēnā, kei tēnā anō tōna ake āhua, tōna ake mauri, tōna ake mana.</p>
        
            <p>"Each and every one has their own uniqueness, life essence and presence."</p>
        
            <p>His statement to the inquiry stated: "From my own experience I know that institutions places of neglect and abuse. They also mean people are denied their human rights and basically denied a proper life.</p>
        
            <p>"The right to education and the right to participate, the right to live free of violence, the right to life are all things at risk in an institution."</p>
        
            <p>The commission said Sir Robert made vital in-roads in helping children with disabilities in institutions around the world through influencing countries to review their policies and practice.</p>
        
            <p>"Sir Robert raised the profile of Easy Read and Plain Language as important formats for making information available within the United Nations (UN) and contributed to enhancing accessibility in UN conferences and meetings.</p>
        
            <p>"In an example of influencing change in specific countries, Sir Robert presented to the Spanish Congress of Deputies event on the rights of persons with learning disabilities. A week later, the Government of Spain announced persons under Guardianship would have the right to vote in the next election for the first time."</p>
        
            <p>At various times, he was the Country Rapporteur for Australia, Canada and Vanuatu.</p>
        
            <p>"I might be first but I most certainly don't want to be the last," Sir Robert said of his advocacy for people with learning disabilities to take to the world stage.</p>
