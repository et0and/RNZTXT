            <p>Fred again.. fans in Wellington have been left dismayed after missing out on tickets to scalpers.</p>
        
            <p>The UK DJ arrived in the capital on Wednesday and confirmed he is performing a show in the city.</p>
        
            <p>The British music artist has been touring Australia for the past few weeks performing in cities such as Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney.</p>
        
            <p>Ever since he started performing across the ditch speculation had been building of whether he would perform shows in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Once tickets went on sale, fans were left sitting in the queue on the Ticketek website while scalpers were already beginning to post tickets online at significantly inflated prices.</p>
        
            <p>Among those fans who missed out was Logan.</p>
        
            <p>He said there was an influx of posts from scalpers on Facebook page Vic Deals this afternoon, and the prices they were charging were "daylight robbery."</p>
        
            <p>"You see all these people just selling tickets non-stop $300, three times the price, if not more."</p>
        
            <p>Logan said he had been anticipating Fred again..'s show for weeks and was gutted to have missed out.</p>
        
            <p>He also thought ticketing agent, Ticketek, could have done more to prevent the scalpers from taking advantage.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has contacted Ticketek for comment.</p>
