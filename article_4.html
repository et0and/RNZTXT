            <p>The final winners of Lotto's $50 million must-be-won draw have claimed their portion, saying they will be able to look after their family for generations.</p>
        
            <p>The draw took place on 8 June, but the Auckland couple, who wanted to remain anonymous, took more than two weeks to check their ticket.</p>
        
            <p>Seven winners split the $50m, meaning each winner received $7.18m.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement from Lotto, the couple said they occasionally purchased Lotto tickets - but decided to pick up a ticket for that special draw as it had to be won.</p>
        
            <p>But after the draw, they did not pay too much attention to the result and were unaware a winning ticket was sold at the store they had purchased from.</p>
        
            <p>"Because we don't buy tickets all the time, we usually only check our tickets when we remember to - we weren't in a rush," the man said.</p>
        
            <p>Weeks later, the man decided to check his ticket which was still in his wife's handbag. Scanning the ticket, the app told him he had won a major prize and to take the ticket into a store.</p>
        
            <p>"I wasn't sure how much I'd won â€¦ but I had a feeling that it was a big amount."</p>
        
            <p>The next day before completing a grocery shop, the couple discovered they had won $7m.</p>
        
            <p>"We were so excited," the man said.</p>
        
            <p>A family meeting was called to tell the couple's children about the win later that day.</p>
        
            <p>One of the children told Lotto they thought something serious had happened - because being asked to get together so quickly was unusual.</p>
        
            <p>"We all sat around the table waiting and that's when they told us they had won $7m with Powerball. We were all so excited for them.</p>
        
            <p>"There were lots of tears for sure. They've worked incredibly hard all their lives for us, they really deserve this," the couple's child said.</p>
        
            <p>The couple's children wanted them to do something special for themselves - like an overseas trip and finish renovations to their home.</p>
        
            <p>But the man said it was all for his kids.</p>
        
            <p>"It's all for them - everything has been. It means so much to know that my family will be looked after."</p>
