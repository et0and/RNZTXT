            <p>Warning: This story mentions suicide.</p>
        
            <p>The jury at the murder trial of an Auckland eye surgeon have heard evidence of how his wife could have died.</p>
        
            <p>Philip Polkinghorne is accused of killing Pauline Hanna in 2021, and staging it as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Defence lawyer Ron Mansfield KC has maintained that Hanna died by suicide after consistent stress from her work in the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out and a history of depression.</p>
        
            <p>The defence this afternoon called evidence from Andrew MacGregor, who conducted a simulation of Hanna's death at the couple's Remuera property, to determine if she could have died in the position Polkinghorne told police he found her in.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Graham Lang has prohibited the publication of details about this simulation due to risk to the public.</p>
        
            <p>MacGregor is a mechanical engineer who conducts investigations into crashes and accidents, and conducted simulations at the Remuera property in June and July 2024.</p>
        
            <p>He said his simulations showed there was sufficient force to cause death.</p>
        
            <p>In cross-examination, crown prosecutor Alysha McClintock made the point that MacGregor's simulation was based only on Polkinghorne's account.</p>
        
            <p>"But you've done it entirely - and I'm not criticising this - on his account of things in order to do what you did."</p>
        
            <p>"That's correct," MacGregor said.</p>
        
            <p>"And that requires quite a bit of interpretation doesn't it, which is a matter for the jury," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She questioned him on the fact that he had to conduct research to make his simulation.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard earlier in the trial that Hanna had not researched suicide before her death.</p>
        
            <p>Mansfield called Regina Haysom as the final witness of the day.</p>
        
            <p>Haysom formerly operated a business called bodyshop, which provided "photographic services" for clients.</p>
        
            <p>"In March 2010, Mrs Polkinghorne contracted with your business to provide photos of herself for the purposes of a surprise present for her husband?" Mansfield questioned.</p>
        
            <p>Haysom confirmed that she did, and there were a number of photographs of Hanna taken and presented in a booklet and in two wall portraits.</p>
        
            <p>In a brief cross examination, McClintock questioned that these photos were taken 11 years before Hanna's death.</p>
        
            <p>"What year was this?" she asked.</p>
        
            <p>"2010, quite a while ago," Haysom replied.</p>
