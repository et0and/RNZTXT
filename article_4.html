            <p>Catholic leaders in Christchurch are signalling their preferred location for a new cathedral precinct to replace a former building that succumbed to the earthquakes.</p>
        
            <p>The 115-year-old Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament on Barbadoes Street was demolished in 2020, after it was badly damaged in the 2010 and 2011 Christchurch quakes.</p>
        
            <p>Three possible locations are being investigated by the Catholic Diocese of Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Bishop Michael Gielen said the diocese preferred to build the new cathedral at the old Barbadoes Street site.</p>
        
            <p>"The advice given to me is that Barbadoes Street - returning to our humble roots - is the best place for us to locate our mother church, our Cathedral.</p>
        
            <p>"Catholic MƒÅori spoke of it as being an anchor."</p>
        
            <p>The diocese will seek feedback on the proposed locations over the coming months.</p>
