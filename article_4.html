            <p>Traffic disruptions are expected for motorists heading into Auckland on the Southern Motorway as a convoy led by Destiny Church leader Brian Tamaki makes its way to the central city.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhlie, counter-protesters were set up on the Market Road bridge crossing State Highway 1 in Newmarket, flying Palestinian flags and signs reading "end mass murder" and "stop the genocide".</p>
        
            <p>In a post on social media ahead of the event, Tamaki said the haka in Parliament made New Zealand the "mockery of the world".</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori's Hauraki Waikato MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke on Thursday tore up a copy of the Treaty Principles Bill and launched into a haka, inspiring other opposition MPs and members of the public gallery to join in. Video of the incident went viral online and made headlines around the world.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaki called it a "Māori meltdown", and in a video filmed from his house showed off a New Zealand flag affixed to the back of a motorcycle, saying all other flags should be "banned".</p>

            <p>Tamaki's rally was expected to reach the Auckland Domain by midday.</p>
        
            <p>The controversial Destiny Church leader is facing charges alongside his wife, Hannah Tamaki, and two others for attending outdoor protests during the Level 3 lockdown in October and November of 2021.</p>
        
            <p>In January 2022, Tamaki was arrested at his home in Auckland after allegedly breaching his bail conditions. He spent 10 days in jail before being released.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaki ran for Parliament in 2023, his Freedom NZ umbrella party receiving 0.33 percent of the vote, putting them 11th.</p>
