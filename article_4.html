            <p>For the first time in four months, a busy Auckland road linking the suburbs of Westmere and Point Chevalier has partially reopened.</p>
        
            <p>Meola Rd closed in December 2023 and was supposed to open to traffic in February 2024.</p>
        
            <p>But Auckland Transport said there was still "much more" work to do and the upgrade would not be completed before the end of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Residents and businesses said the disruption was taking a huge toll.</p>
        
            <p>Upgrades to drainage, underground power lines and cycleways are due for Meola Rd as road cones, traffic management and construction fill the streets.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, the road has partially reopened to one lane of traffic with multiple stop-go sections between 7am and 7pm.</p>

            <p>Outside of these times, two-way traffic can operate but on-road parking is off-limits. Some sections are still cordoned off.</p>
        
            <p>One Point Chevalier resident said there were huge delays getting around by car.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes it's challenging getting to and from Saint Lukes, these things are sent to try us I guess."</p>
        
            <p>Side streets like Kiwi Rd are bearing the brunt of the construction.</p>
        
            <p>Local resident Bill said extra traffic down his street was causing accidents.</p>
        
            <p>"The car, I think it got hit out here a few weeks ago, just the amount of traffic. This was the bus route as well and you just can't get parking around here, quite horrendous."</p>
        
            <p>Many residents like Lily who live on Meola Rd said they needed to be out of their driveways at certain times to avoid getting stuck.</p>
        
            <p>Checkpoint bumped into her as she was searching for where she parked her car on a side street.</p>
        
            <p>"I mean it encourages me to get a bit of exercise every so often, but it is frustrating and there have been times where we haven't moved the car in time and then they've dug a big pit and we can't get out and it just makes journeys quite a lot slower if you have to ask people to put some gravel in so you can drive out."</p>
        
            <p>The roadworks are also taking a toll on businesses.</p>

Corner Cafe co-owner Lan Lai Kai said business was down 50 percent since the start of road works.

            <p>On Point Chevalier Rd, Corner Cafe co-owner Lan Lai Kai said business was down 50 percent since the start of road works.</p>
        
            <p>"The noise, the dust, if it was not for our regular customers coming to support us we'd be closed already."</p>
        
            <p>The cafe had to let some part-time staff go and was not able to pay themselves, Kai said.</p>
        
            <p>They had been selling different products like bubble tea and ice creams to attract more customers.</p>
        
            <p>Kai said the 'open for business' banners from AT were all they had to show in terms of support.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand this must be done, I mean for the greater good for the community, but we also suffer financial loss. I don't know how long I can survive, this is worse than Covid."</p>
        
            <p>WaitematƒÅ local board chair Genevieve Sage said there were mixed feelings about the road works but key walking and cycling connections would be welcomed.</p>
        
            <p>"People are just wanting it to get done and be finished and then they're going to have a nice new road, good infrastructure for people to walk and cycle on so once it's finished it's going to be fantastic."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Auckland Transport infrastructure and places director Murry Burt said: "Initially, basic road improvements were anticipated to be completed in the first half of this year, however, as planning and understanding community needs progressed, it became clear that AT could future-proof the area and prevent future disruption by doing more all at once."</p>
        
            <p>He said good progress had been made and the extended road closure meant AT would finish the combined projects faster overall, by up to two months and would save about $400,000.</p>
        
            <p>AT was doing its best to minimise the effects of these works on businesses, neighbours, pedestrians, and motorists, Burt said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are also appealing to the public to reduce non-essential travel in the area by taking alternative routes wherever possible."</p>
