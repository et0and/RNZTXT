            <p>An "extreme" geomagnetic storm is affecting Earth at present.</p>
        
            <p>Material fired out from a sun spot, is crashing into the planet's atmosphere this weekend .</p>
        
            <p>Transpower says it has put the electricity grid into a 'more' resilient state to protect equipment.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson says today's geomagnetically induced currents are below the levels Transpower has been preparing for in its 'worst case scenario' planning.</p>
        
            <p>Transpower says it is still not anticipating having to cut power in any areas, but teams are continuing to monitor the event.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the day it issued a grid emergency notice and said it was removing some transmission lines from service across the South Island as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>Follow RNZ's updates earlier today: </p>
        
            <p>The storm has the potential to disrupt power and satellites, as well as communications and GPS.</p>
        
            <p>The US Space Weather Prediction Centre says G5 (extreme) geomagnetic storms can impact power grids, satellites, and radio communications.</p>
        
            <p>The solar storm is expected to peak tonight, with the US Space Weather Prediction Centre forecasting severe conditions from 6-9pm (NZ time) on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>NIWA says although most solar events do not cause much impact, this is an "unusually strong event" so it pays to be prepared.</p>
        
            <p>It recommends people ensure they have charged batteries and flashlights in case the power goes out.</p>
