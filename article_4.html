            <p>A 28-year-old Kaikōura man has been charged for his alleged involvement in the large-scale scamming of New Zealanders through text messages.</p>
        
            <p>It follows an investigation by Te Tari Taiwhenua, the Department of Internal Affairs.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation was part of Operation Cargo, which uncovered a transnational criminal network of scammers thought to be responsible for most SMS scams in New Zealand last year.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Internal Affairs digital messaging and systems manager Joe Teo said investigators were seeing new methods of SMS scamming not seen before.</p>
        
            <p>"A new approach from scammers means a tactical strategy from multiple organisations is needed to stay ahead of trends in the SMS scam space and stop scammers in their tracks."</p>
        
            <p>Teo said police, telecommunications providers and New Zealand banks had worked together on the investigation in order to combat the scams.</p>
        
            <p>Through a joint search warrant undertaken by DIA and police, investigators recovered a large number of SIM cards, a significant amount of cash and multiple electronic devices used to spread scams on a large scale.</p>
        
            <p>Tasman organised crime manager Detective Senior Sergeant Shane Dye said the investigation was a great example of agencies working together successfully with the aim of reducing financial harm and holding offenders responsible.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who receives a scam SMS text message, can report it free of charge by forwarding the message to 7726 and following the prompts.</p>
        
            <p>If anyone is the victim of a scam and has not yet reported it or doesn't know what action to take, contact your bank and then the police on 105.</p>
