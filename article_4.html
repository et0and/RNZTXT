            <p>There is no clear end in sight for the student "rent strike" at the University of Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>And an expert is warning students could face consequences if they continue withholding rent.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the Students for Fair Rent group have been refusing to pay rent for almost a month, demanding a blanket rent reduction and safeguards against future rises.</p>
        
            <p>The protest was sparked by an annual 8 percent rise in rents at the start of this year.</p>
        
            <p>Weekly rent at the country's largest student residence, Waipārūrū Hall, has increased from $470 last year to $510 this year.</p>
        
            <p>Students for Fair Rent Chair Matthew Lee said while they have had discussions with the university, they have no plans to end their strike.</p>
        
            <p>"They've asked us to go through some alternative routes to raise this issue with the university - routes that historically have done nothing."</p>
        
            <p>Lee said some students taking part in the "rent strike" have had their key cards deactivated and had been given the choice to resume payments or have a meeting with their residential manager, where they were often pressured to withdraw from the protest.</p>
        
            <p>A University of Auckland spokesperson said students know the cost of residences when they sign up for them.</p>
        
            <p>They said access cards sometimes stop working but they can be reactivated at a 24/7 reception. If students were behind on rent, staff would "remind them to follow up on payment or to book a meeting".</p>
        
            <p>Organisers claimed 196 people were taking part in the strike, but the university said only 16 of the 4200 residents of university accommodation had notified they were taking part.</p>
        
            <p>Citizens Advice Bureau National Advisor Sacha Green said while the university was required to act in good faith, it had several options if students refused to pay rent.</p>
        
            <p>It could not only terminate a student's tenancy but also charge late fees, limit their course selection, withhold exam results, pursue legal action and refer a student to a debt collection agency.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no legal basis for a 'rent strike'. The university has the right to decide to terminate the agreement.</p>
        
            <p>"Student accommodation is not subject to the Residential Tenancies Act so you don't have those mechanisms that are sometimes used to balance rights."</p>
