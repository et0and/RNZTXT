            <p>Aucklanders have been flocking to the region's parks and beaches in great numbers this summer.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council regional parks and reserves manager Scott De Silva said rangers reported large visitor numbers in many areas.</p>
        
            <p>But they had also been finding some rule-breakers spoiling the fun at the region's best spots, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The most popular spots for Aucklanders this summer have been Long Bay, Tāwharanui, Shakespear Regional Park and Waitawa.</p>
        
            <p>The high visitor numbers had increased demand for carparking, with limited space available in some places, De Silva said.</p>
        
            <p>He reminded visitors they were not allowed to drive on any beaches, parks or picnic areas.</p>
        
            <p>"This rule is crucial to follow at all times but particularly pertinent over the summer holiday period, to ensure visitors, wildlife and fragile coastal eco-systems remain protected," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Park rangers have reported illegal freedom campers, with people feigning innocence and saying they aren't aware of the rules, De Silva said.</p>
        
            <p>They had also seen dogs let loose on beaches, where they were not allowed, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are seeing dogs on prohibited beach areas, which is disappointing when many of our native birds are vulnerable mid-way through their breeding season," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"During hot summer days, your pooch is likely to be more comfortable left at home."</p>
        
            <p>De Silva reminded people to check if camping is allowed before heading out to one of Auckland's parks.</p>
        
            <p>"It helps to always come prepared with plenty of hydration, sunblock, and shade. All our regional parks are rubbish free so visitors must plan to take their rubbish home."</p>
        
            <p>He reminded visitors to always check Safeswim, because many of the region's inner city beaches had recently been hindered by sewage causing black flag no-swim notices.</p>
        
            <p>Adventurers heading out on a hike should also be aware of track closures, De Silva said.</p>
        
            <p>Four reserves on the North Shore remain completely closed after damage from Cyclone Gabrielle and the Auckland Anniversary floods.</p>
        
            <p>Thirty tracks are fully or partially closed across Devonport, Takapuna, Kaipātiki, East Coast Bays and the Hibiscus Coast, awaiting repairs.</p>
        
            <p>De Silva said hikers should tell someone where they were going, take communication devices, food and appropriate clothing.</p>
        
            <p>"Overall, visitors are generally showing respect for our parks, each other and the vital work our rangers do to keep these environments safe for everyone."</p>
