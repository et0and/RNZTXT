            <p>New data shows Pacific language uptake in New Zealand's primary and secondary schools has grown 40 percent over the last five years.</p>
        
            <p>Figures released by the Ministry of Education showed more than 11,000 students in 128 schools studied Pacific languages in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>In 2019 only 8000 students were studying Pacific languages, and only 88 schools offered learning opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>The increase is a huge achievement, Te Aratai College's Feleti Pesefea - who teaches Samoan and music - told RNZ Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>"It's an opportunity for them to learn the language, and the culture, and then hopefully be the carriers of that."</p>
        
            <p>The report included schools that offered Pacific language courses or immersion teaching. Most immersion teaching was done at primary or intermediate level.</p>
        
            <p>For Pesefea, being able to teach the younger generation was important to him, as the Samoan language was not available to him as a subject when he was at high school.</p>
        
            <p>"Learning languages can go hand in hand with learning the culture."</p>
        
            <p>Samoan, Tongan and Cook Islands Māori were the most commonly studied languages, while Fijian, Niuean, and Tokelauan were the least common, with only one Wellington school offering Tokelauan this year, according to the data.</p>

            <p>Ali'imuamua Batcheler taught Samoan at Te Aho o Te Kura Ponamu, an online school, and created the first curriculum for learning Samoan online.</p>
        
            <p>Batcheler said the numbers were a pat on the back for teachers and she was "extremely happy".</p>
        
            <p>"Especially [considering] Covid," she added.</p>
        
            <p>While teachers set the tone, outside influences - such as the Ministry for Pacific Peoples' language weeks - have encouraged students into languages at school, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Celebrating the Pacific languages each year has helped."</p>
        
            <p>And Pesefea agreed community played a factor in the increase.</p>
        
            <p>"Things like Polyfest, and cultural performance events… we try to include it in everyday things at school [too]."</p>

            <p>MPP language unit principal advisor Louisa Vaeluaga said the events were run to familiarise Kiwis with the cultures of the islands.</p>
        
            <p>Vaeluaga said Pacific languages were on the decline overall, which is why the language weeks were introduced.</p>
        
            <p>"Pacific languages are a cornerstone of our health and wellbeing and identity as Pacific Peoples. It's about… bringing that heightened visibility for our Pacific [cultures]."</p>
        
            <p>Kiribati, Pukapukan and Tahitian have been on offer in the past, but lacked the interest to warrant courses this year.</p>
        
            <p>Batcheler said every Pasifika student should have the opportunity to learn their mother tongue, but qualified teachers were hard to come by due to a lack of resources.</p>
        
            <p>If Batcheler could have her way, every student would learn a second language.</p>
        
            <p>"When you go overseas, everyone has a second language. And here in New Zealand, we're just trying to encourage people to speak te reo [Māori]."</p>
        
            <p>She suggested giving students "some kind of incentive to get the kids to want to teach [languages]".</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Qualifications Authority currently offers 33 language courses, with 12 active courses (courses used by schools) being Pacific languages.</p>
