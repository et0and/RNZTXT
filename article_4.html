            <p>An Air New Zealand flight has landed back in Auckland after an unscheduled overnight stop-over in Guam.</p>
        
            <p>The flight from Taipei to Auckland was diverted when an odour seeped through the cabin.</p>
        
            <p>It landed on the US territory of Guam in the Western Pacific and passengers were taken to hotels for the night.</p>
        
            <p>Engineers carried out a full service on the area of the aircraft where the odour was identified and the aircraft was cleared to continue on to Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>The airline thanked its customers for coping with the added complexity of stopping at an airport it does not usually operate at.</p>
