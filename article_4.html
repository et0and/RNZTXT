            <p>A 25-year-old man has appeared in the Hutt Valley District Court over an armed stand-off in Lower Hutt yesterday that lasted more than 10 hours.</p>
        
            <p>The man - who has name suppression - is charged with using a firearm against police and resisting officers.</p>
        
            <p>Family members were in court today for his brief appearance, during which he appeared topless, with bruising and scratches on his face and torso.</p>
        
            <p>During Tuesday's incident, police cordoned off a section of High St in the suburb of Avalon at about 9.30am following a report of a man with a gun at a property with three other occupants.</p>
        
            <p>Three nearby schools were put into lockdown as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>Those people were allowed to leave at about 10.30am and the Armed Offenders Squad and the police negotiation team remained in contact with the man over the day.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly before 8pm, police entered the house and a man was taken into custody.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Mary O'Dwyer has today deferred his bail hearing until next week, to allow time for the address to be checked.</p>
