        <h2>Milo removal could have cost Health NZ $3m - union</h2>
        <p>
The provision of hot drinks is enshrined in some health workers' contracts, "so if this was done as a cost-saving measure, it would have done anything but".

            <p>Health New Zealand's "misguided" bid to remove Milo from staff rooms could have ended up costing it millions of dollars, according to one doctors' union.</p>
        
            <p>Health Commissioner Lester Levy personally intervened after hearing of the move, part of wider cost-cutting across the sector.</p>
        
            <p>Along with acting chief executive Dale Bramley, he issued a fresh directive on Wednesday afternoon "to ensure that Milo remains available to all".</p>
        
            <p>"When I first became aware yesterday that it had been proposed that Health NZ switch to an alternative to Milo to save some money, I immediately put a stop to that and issued a communication to all staff that in the case of Milo the status-quo will prevail," he wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"I know from our staff on the front-line that they particularly enjoy Milo, and it should continue to be available to them."</p>
        
            <p>Tea, coffee, hot chocolate, Milo, and sugar remained available for staff, he said.</p>

            <p>Resident Doctors Association executive director Dr Deborah Powell said she was "somewhat surprised" to hear the commissioner had involved himself at this level - but confirmed staff were relieved by the backdown.</p>
        
            <p>She was contacted by outraged members last week about the original decision, which would also have seen sugar replaced with sucral.</p>
        
            <p>"I have to say it really annoyed a lot of people," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had nurses get in touch to say 'We can't give patients much these days, but at least we can keep offering someone a drink of Milo if they've been waiting for hours in an over-booked outpatient clinic'.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's not just clinical staff affected."</p>
        
            <p>Provision of hot drinks was actually enshrined in some health workers' collective contracts, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If that isn't provided the employer has to pay an allowance. So if this was done as a cost-saving measure, it would have done anything but.</p>
        
            <p>"I think I calculated it would have added $2.3m cost for nurses alone to Te Whatu Ora if they removed that provision."</p>
        
            <p>Powell said the proposal was probably the result of "over-enthusiasm" on the part of some official.</p>
        
            <p>"I know they're under pressure to contain costs but there are implications to many of the things we do and consultation is required so we make good decisions.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just a bit of window dressing, it's so we don't make mistakes."</p>
        
            <p>Powell said she hoped the episode would send a message to Health New Zealand management that staff needed to be involved in decision-making.</p>
