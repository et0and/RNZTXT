            <p>Flights have been disrupted by high winds in New Plymouth while parts of Hawke's Bay and Gisborne had heavy rain overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Six Air New Zealand services were cancelled and there were long delays for other flights due to a strong crosswind at New Plymouth, the airline said.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said the conditions may not ease until Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand was rebooking customers on the next available service and said it appreciated their patience and understanding.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, MetService said there has been heavy rain overnight in parts of Hawke's Bay and Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>A rain watch in place for that region has been extended until Thursday with thunderstorms possible in same places late morning.</p>
        
            <p>MetService warned a low could bring periods of heavy falls over the next two days, especially to the Wairoa district, where some shops were flooded yesterday after an overnight deluge.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 80mm fell in the Wairoa district Monday overnight with the township inundated around 3am.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay Regional Council and Wairoa District Council are monitoring the Wairoa River Mouth.</p>
        
            <p>"River levels at town bridge are fluctuating about 1 metre between high and low tides, which is normal in this type of weather event, Hawke's Bay Regional Council said.</p>
        
            <p>The sea swell is forecast to stay high through to Thursday.</p>
