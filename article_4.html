            <p>School holidays do not come cheap.</p>
        
            <p>A total of $145 for a family of four to go to Kelly Tarltons, $80 for a trip to the zoo, at least $40 for a movie - that is without popcorn or an ice cream.</p>
        
            <p>How much will these school holidays hit your pocket?</p>
        
            <p>It was mid-morning and the foyer of Event Cinemas on the top floor of Auckland's West City mall was bustling with children heading to the movies.</p>
        
            <p>Most families had signed up to a Tuesday promotion so they have scored a deal on cheap tickets.</p>
        
            <p>One mother told First Up she paid $40 for four tickets.</p>
        
            <p>"We're going to spend maybe like $40-50 on snacks, popcorn, coke, lollies and then we might do a little window browse and end up getting one or two things extra. So we're looking at about $100."</p>
        
            <p>Ordinarily, movie tickets here would set parents back $16.50 for an adult and $15.50 for a child - elsewhere it could cost up to $25.50 and $19.50 for a child.</p>
        
            <p>What about other school holiday activities?</p>
        
            <p>A family ticket for two adults and two kids to Sea Life Kelly Tarltons Aquarium in Auckland is $145.</p>

            <p>A visit to Auckland Zoo will set a family of four back nearly $80, it's $69 for Wellington Zoo and $91.50 for a family to visit Orana Park in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>In Rotorua, it is $162 for a family of four to enjoy a ride on the gondola and luge.</p>
        
            <p>And in Tauranga, a family pass to the Mount Hot Pools is $70.</p>
        
            <p>One grandmother told First Up she would spend close to $200 for a day's outing with her grandsons who were 8 and 10.</p>
        
            <p>Another mum who was having lunch with her daughter said although she was on what would be considered a "very good salary", her family had to tighten their purse strings because of the rising cost of living.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't done this going out together like this since the last school holidays," she said.</p>
        
            <p>One mother who had just arrived at the mall said she had already spent $40 and they were yet to have lunch.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't even got to the $2 shop yet."</p>
        
            <p>Just a few metres from the mall, Zone Bowling in Henderson has laser tag, arcade games and bumper cars.</p>
        
            <p>One dad said although his children would have lunch at home, he had already spent $115 on arcade games and bowling.</p>

            <p>It was 11am, but the fun had only just started for one mum-of-three.</p>
        
            <p>"We've spent $120 so far - that's for three kids for bowling, laser tag, bumper cars.</p>
        
            <p>"And then they also get to do an hour on the games."</p>
        
            <p>She was expecting to spend $20-30 on pies and sandwiches for lunch.</p>
        
            <p>Other parents at the mall said the cost of school holiday programmes was now prohibitive.</p>
        
            <p>One mother said her son's usual school holiday programme had nearly doubled the daily charge in less than one year.</p>
        
            <p>"It used to be $30 for the around six hours and included some snack and also some activity.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment it's $58."</p>
        
            <p>She said she preferred to take time off work and spend it with her son instead of sending him to the holiday programme.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the high cost of some activities, there were some free options.</p>
        
            <p>Many museums around the country like Te Papa in Wellington and Auckland's War Memorial Museum were free to visit.</p>

            <p>And for those in Hamilton, a visit to the gardens would not cost a cent.</p>
        
            <p>Teenagers First Up spoke to said summer holidays can be easier on mum and dad's wallet.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really easy to just go to the beach for free, maybe pack a picnic from home."</p>
        
            <p>Back at Auckland's West City mall, it was a different story.</p>
        
            <p>One 8-year-old was planning to buy Pokemon cards and said his mother had promised to buy him some other things.</p>
        
            <p>"[My budget is] like $20."</p>
