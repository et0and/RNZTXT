            <p>Police have revealed the name of a man they shot dead in a small Waikato town last week.</p>
        
            <p>Paeroa man Christopher Taukiri, 31, was killed in a standoff with police in Matamata on Thursday, 15 February.</p>
        
            <p>He had allegedly led them on a chase from Hamilton after failing to stop his vehicle when asked, and presented a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>Police said once in the Matamata area, 50km away, he crashed a stolen vehicle and fled into a home, where he threatened two parents and a child with a gun.</p>
        
            <p>When officers arrived at the scene, the armed man was confronted, shot and critically injured.</p>
        
            <p>"Officers immediately provided medical attention, however, he died a short time later," police said last week.</p>
        
            <p>"A critical incident investigation into what happened remains ongoing," police said on Friday. The Independent Police Conduct Authority has been notified too.</p>
        
            <p>They were still seeking footage or photos of the vehicles involved in the pursuit, including a silver Mazda MPV and a black BMW 120i, which crashed on McLaren Road.</p>
        
            <p>Matamata-Piako deputy mayor James Thomas last week said it was a traumatic time for the tight-knit rural community.</p>
        
            <p>"[It's a] tragedy that someone has lost their life but a tragedy that someone was basically held hostage."</p>
