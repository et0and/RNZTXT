            <p>An Auckland widow with an irrational belief that her late husband's lawyer somehow contributed to his death made "vile" violent threats against his family and others on social media.</p>
        
            <p>She also threw rocks through people's windows and poured paint on cars.</p>
        
            <p>Her victims during four months of "over-the-top" offending, possibly sparked by grief and psychological issues, included vulnerable elderly people and children.</p>
        
            <p>Olesya Yugova has now been sentenced and released after spending more than a year in custody on remand and then pleading guilty to 24 charges of threatening to kill and two of burglary.</p>
        
            <p>Yugova's offending occurred between September 2022 and January 2023, and involved two groups of people and a further individual, court documents show. All the names and identifying details of the victims were suppressed.</p>
        
            <p>The first group were relatives of her late husband's lawyer.</p>
        
            <p>A decision from the High Court at Auckland says Yugova formed an "irrational belief" that the lawyer had caused or contributed to her husband's death for his own monetary gain.</p>
        
            <p>She posted threats on social media threatening to harm members of the lawyer's family "in vile and violent terms", the decision said.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the victims were elderly and vulnerable.</p>
        
            <p>Yugova went to the home of some of the victims, poured paint on cars parked in their garage and threw rocks at the property, breaking two windows.</p>
        
            <p>The second group of victims were members of another extended family. They were also harassed in social media posts.</p>
        
            <p>The individual victim had a disagreement with Yugova at the Auckland City Mission. Yugova then posted threats and incited violence against that person on social media.</p>
        
            <p>High Court Justice Tracey Walker said Yugova's threats and other behaviour had caused the victims stress, anxiety and fear, particularly as the threats targeted extended family members, including young children.</p>
        
            <p>"I have no doubt that Ms Yugova's obsessive pursuit of the victims has had a significant emotional toll on them," Justice Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>"This was serious offending by any measure."</p>
        
            <p>Yugova was in custody from 27 January 2023 until her sentencing in the North Shore District Court on 1 March 2024 - a total of 399 days.</p>
        
            <p>During that time she went through a number of lawyers and received a sentencing indication of 21 months in prison.</p>
        
            <p>The District Court judge said Yugova's "bizarre and over the top" offending suggested possible psychological issues, unresolved anger and grief.</p>
        
            <p>Because people who are sentenced to less than two years in jail usually only serve half their time, Yugova expected she would be released on time served.</p>
        
            <p>This also meant she could expect to be subject only to the statutory six months of release conditions that follow a short jail term, under the supervision of a probation officer.</p>
        
            <p>She was instead sentenced to two years of intensive supervision beginning on her sentencing date - effectively a more restrictive sentence than the one she had been expecting.</p>
        
            <p>She appealed her sentence to the High Court.</p>
        
            <p>"Ms Yugova contends that she accepted the indication on the basis that time spent remanded in custody would mean that she would be released," Justice Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>"She argues that, although a sentence of supervision is a lesser sentence in terms of the sentencing hierarchy, in her unique circumstances, the sentence was practically more restrictive."</p>
        
            <p>Justice Walker said the length of time spent in custody on remand before Yugova was sentenced led her to the conclusion that intensive supervision for 24 months was a further "undue restriction" on her liberty.</p>
        
            <p>She said this was "not justified on the present material before the court".</p>
        
            <p>Justice Walker quashed the supervision sentence and replaced it with one of 21 months of imprisonment, with six months of release conditions.</p>
        
            <p>As Yugova spent so long in prison on remand, she has already served her time.</p>
        
            <p>Her release conditions include a ban on accessing social media and a psychological assessment.</p>
