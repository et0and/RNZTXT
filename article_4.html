            <p>A 19-year-old charged with murdering another teen in Grey Lynn can not be named yet, despite police objection.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Kirsten Lummis granted the murder-accused interim name suppression at the Auckland District Court on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>But police said revealing the defendant's name may help them locate a getaway car and a firearm they believe was used to kill Maxwel-Dee Repia.</p>
        
            <p>A defence lawyer cited concerns about the accused's psychological state and safety as part of their bid for name suppression. The suppression order would expire in seven days, unless it was extended.</p>
        
            <p>Lummis acknowledged family in the public gallery supporting the defendant, who stood in custody in the dock.</p>
        
            <p>She also expressed condolences to Repia's family in attendance.</p>
        
            <p>The accused has been charged with murder and three counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>
        
            <p>A second man, 18, faced a charge of being an accessory after the fact to murder and three counts of being an accessory after the fact to wounding.</p>
