            <p>Police have arrested 25 people and found more than 11,000 cannabis plants in a major operation aimed at gangs.</p>
        
            <p>Armed police have raided 39 properties across Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>During the operation 29 guns were seized, along with more than 80 grams of methamphetamine and $7610.</p>
        
            <p>Two stolen vehicles and a stolen motorbike were also recovered.</p>
        
            <p>Operation Emerald targeted the large-scale cultivation of drugs, which provided a large income stream for gangs, District Commander Superintendent Tim Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>Property searches stretched over five days, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The Greazy Dogs gang will be feeling particularly hard hit, with more than 2500 plants removed from paddocks surrounding their gang pad and residential properties in Tauranga," he said/</p>
        
            <p>Police have laid several drug and firearm-related charges, and more charges and arrests were expected.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the accused have already appeared in court.</p>
        
            <p>During the operation, 11,372 cannabis plants ranging from seedlings to plants 2 metres high were sprayed or destroyed.</p>
        
            <p>Police recovered 729 plants at one Western Bay of Plenty address, 1.6kg of harvested cannabis at a Taup≈ç property, and more than 4kg of edibles at an Eastern Bay of Plenty address.</p>
        
            <p>Operation Emerald alone last year prevented $126.8m in social harm to communities and prevented gangs and organised crime from earning $128m.</p>
        
            <p>The 2022/23 operation resulted in 35,097 plants being seized or destroyed, along with 93.452kg of cannabis head and plant material, with a combined street value of $128m.</p>
