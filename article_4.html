            <p>Hospital-based MRI and nuclear medicine technologists have stopped work for four days from 6am Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Their union, Apex, said they were striking because of failures by Health New Zealand to address pay claims.</p>
        
            <p>The difference between public and private pay rates was more than 30 percent, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Apex advocate Abbey Hebson said Te Whatu Ora could not retain staff and was having to outsource scans.</p>
        
            <p>"Over 30 percent of MRI & NM scans are outsourced to private radiology providers because Te Whatu Ora does not have the capacity to perform these scans in house."</p>
        
            <p>She said outsourcing cost $20 million last year.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be a better use of money to instead invest into Te Whatu Ora's own staff in order to future proof the workforce and keep a public MRI & NM service going."</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora/Health New Zealand has been contacted for comment.</p>
