            <p>If you're like me, there's one appliance in your kitchen that's become a staple - the air fryer.</p>
        
            <p>I love how it lightens the load of hands-on cooking during busy weeks. Chuck on a roast or some lamb cutlets, a quiche or roast veg, but when it comes to cleaning it, it's not so simple.</p>
        
            <p>We asked some experts to explain the easiest methods to clean your air fryer without scrubbing.</p>
        
            <p>University of Melbourne food scientist and associate professor Senaka Ranadheera says proper cleaning of kitchen appliances helps stop the spread of harmful bacteria that can cause food poisoning.</p>
        
            <p>"Cleaning helps remove food particles from cooking appliances," he says. "Otherwise, harmful pathogenic microorganisms and food spoilage microorganisms can grow."</p>
        
            <p>Fiona Mair has cleaned many different types of air fryers in her role as kitchen expert for consumer group Choice.</p>
        
            <p>"Like many bench-top appliances out there, cleaning air fryers can be a little bit of a pain, because of their parts," she says.</p>
        
            <p>Although they use little to no added oil, the grease and fat still accumulate inside the cavity of the air fryer, which can become quite difficult to clean.</p>
        
            <p>Kristen Menard's 'how-to' video on cleaning an air fryer notched up more than eight million views last year.</p>
        
            <p>The content creator from the UK uses dishwashing liquid, bicarb soda and boiling water in the air fryer basket as soon as she's finished cooking.</p>
        
            <p>She leaves it to soak for five minutes, then rinses with water and wipes it out.</p>
        
            <p>"I then use a damp cloth for the elements [once they've cooled] and a multi surface spray for the outside," she says.</p>
        
            <p>Choice's Fiona Mair also recommends this method, but says you can opt to use vinegar instead of bicarb soda to help remove oil and sticky residue.</p>
        
            <p>Start by draining off any of the oil that's accumulated.</p>
        
            <p>"If you've done marinated chicken or something like that, and it's quite sticky or baked on, just soak it in warm soapy water.</p>
        
            <p>"I would probably use the bicarb or vinegar... with the water, then they're quite easy just to wipe out, after a little bit of soaking."</p>
        
            <p>Mair says you can use a similar method to not only clean the basket, but also inside the appliance.</p>
        
            <p>Start by putting warm water, detergent, and some bicarb or vinegar in the draw, and return it to the air fryer.</p>
        
            <p>"Just heat it on like 100 degrees for 5-10 minutes and let the steam clean the interior of the air fryer."</p>
