        <h2>As it happened: PM Christopher Luxon pays tribute to Kiingi Tuheitia</h2>
        <p>
The Prime Minister said he will remember the Māori King as someone who brought love, hope and peace.
</p>
        
            <p>Thousands are paying their respects to Kiingi Tuheitia at Tuurangawaewae Marae on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Among them, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who paid an emotional tribute to Kiingi Tuheitia, a leader he greatly respected.</p>
        
            <p>He says Kiingi Tuheitia brought positivity and optimism to his work, wielded his mana with patience and humility, and his leadership and aroha will never be forgotten.</p>
        
            <p>"The best leaders are those that carry themselves with personal humility, but also have massive professional determination as well, and he had massive determination around a central organising idea, which was kotahitanga, but he did it all without ego, and with humility.</p>
        
            <p>Tuheitia was a keen observer of the games being played, and had a wicked sense of humour, but was always focused on the end goal of unity, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"I've seen a lot of leaders around the world, and he was a leader I've always admired and respected ... it was his personal humility that gave him huge amounts of influence with people."</p>
        
            <p>Tainui have built a strong economic engine in recent years, and are using it for the social good of the people, which was impressive and the right thing to do, Luxon said.</p>
        
            <p>The Māori king died in hospital in the early hours of Friday morning after heart surgery.</p>
        
            <p>His body was then taken to the marae, where it will lie in state for at least five days before being buried on Taupiri mountain.</p>
        
            <p>Tainui would be looking after the kiingitanga over the next few days, with the new monarch likely to be crowned on the final day of Kiingi Tuheitia's tangi.</p>
