            <p>Helicopters and firefighters are back at the Black Jack fire on the Coromandel Peninsula this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters battled strong winds and steep terrain to fight the fire in Kūaotunu after it broke out on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>It was under control by Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>The fire had not grown overnight, but while conditions were calm on Monday morning, the winds were forecast to pick up during the day.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency Incident Controller Shane Bromley said three helicopters would provide an air attack that would focus on the western flank of the fire on steep and inaccessible terrain.</p>
        
            <p>Four ground crews would continue work mopping up hotspots on the eastern and southern fronts, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Black Jack Road will be under traffic management today, with managed convoys in and out providing access for residents and those with essential business in the area."</p>
        
            <p>The walking track in the area remained closed.</p>
