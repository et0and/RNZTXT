            <p>A 10-year-old is among a group of youths accused of fleeing Auckland police in two stolen cars last night.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City East area prevention manager Inspector Rachel Dolheguy said police responded to reports of the cars travelling in tandem on a residential street in Pt England just before midnight.</p>
        
            <p>When police arrived, both vehicles "fled at speed in different directions".</p>
        
            <p>"Police units elected not to pursue, and the vehicles movements were tracked before the Police Air Support Unit was able to get overhead to provide further assistance. A short time later, both vehicles were located abandoned on Point England Road."</p>
        
            <p>She says the occupants, aged between 10 and 16, abandoned the cars and a police dog handler found them at a nearby address.</p>
        
            <p>All seven have been referred to Youth Aid.</p>
        
            <p>"This was a great example of our policing teams working together to hold offenders to account," Dolheguy said.</p>
