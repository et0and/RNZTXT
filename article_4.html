            <p>There were emotional scenes in the Far North on Thursday as district councillors passed a motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza as well as condemning violence and terror against civilians on both sides of the conflict.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Moko Tepania, who put the motion forward, acknowledged a statement by a council on the other side of the world would have little direct effect in quelling the war.</p>
        
            <p>"But if our small voice can show the leadership of our nation they need to act, then I very much support it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>About 60 members of the public turned out at short notice to support the motion, many of whom brought placards and Palestinian flags.</p>
        
            <p>A series of amendments were made to the original motion, including the addition of the word "permanent" to the call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.</p>
        
            <p>Also added was a request that the prime minister and minister of foreign affairs show their support and call for peace.</p>
        
            <p>In an impassioned speech, councillor Tāmati Rākena said the council should not stop at calling for an end to violence, but should also support humanitarian aid and rebuilding of the territory.</p>
        
            <p>"We have the power to make a difference, though we are a small part of our universe," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor John Vujcich said he agreed with the need for a ceasefire but did not support the motion as worded.</p>
        
            <p>The current war started on 7 October last year when Hamas committed atrocities on Israeli civilians and brought hostages, alive and dead, back to Gaza, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The council was effectively asking Israel not to get its hostages back, and had been caught up in the emotion of worldwide protests, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Vujcich's speech was punctuated by tears and shouts from the public gallery, with at least one person ushered out of the chambers.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Mayor Kelly Stratford said she supported the motion but had been contacted by constituents who also had concerns about the wording.</p>
        
            <p>To ensure the motion reflected the views of as many people as possible, she proposed the motion be amended by adding condemnation of all acts of violence and terror against civilians, on both sides of the conflict, as well as a call for the immediate return of hostages.</p>
        
            <p>Another amendment, from councillor Hilda Halkyard-Harawira, called for immediate humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>The amended motion was passed with one abstention.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the public who attended the meeting came from every corner of Northland, in particular from the Hokianga-based Palestine Solidarity Group.</p>

            <p>Those who spoke in favour of the motion included Palestinian-English woman Debbie Abbas-Ruawai of Kerikeri.</p>
        
            <p>She said she felt shame and guilt at being unable to help family members trapped in Gaza, and until two days ago was not even sure if they were still alive.</p>
        
            <p>Today's meeting at the Far North District Council chambers in Kaikohe started in extraordinary fashion with the council's te reo interpreter - the acclaimed opera singer Kawiti Waetford - opening proceedings with a himene (hymn) in place of the usual prayer.</p>
        
            <p>Other local authorities to have passed similar motions calling for a Gaza ceasefire include Christchurch City, Nelson City and Whanganui District councils.</p>
