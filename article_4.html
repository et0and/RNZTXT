            <p>Churches in Carterton are holding a prayer service tonight following the fatal shooting of a man in south Wairarapa.</p>
        
            <p>Doreion Peri Ropata Hard, 23, died on Saturday after he was found in a vehicle with a gunshot wound.</p>
        
            <p>The discovery came following a report of a shot or shots fired at a vehicle as it was driven out of the Fresh Choice supermarket in nearby Featherston, sending emergency services rushing to the site at about 4pm on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Two men, aged 23 and 25, were arrested and charged with murder.</p>
        
            <p>St Marks Anglican Church Carterton priest Hennie Northnagel told RNZ they would host an event alongside other churches in the town at 7pm Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The prayer service would be held in the click and collect section of the New World Carterton carpark.</p>
        
            <p>Northnagel said the shooting followed the recent spate of churches burnt in Masterton.</p>
        
            <p>"I think our communities are feeling stressed and concerned for each other, the idea is to get together and pray for our community and also for what has happened here."</p>
        
            <p>He asked for people attending not to park in the carpark so supermarket customers weren't disrupted.</p>
