            <p>Victims of the Whakaari / White Island disaster returned to the Auckland District Court to confront the five tourism companies found guilty in last year's trial.</p>
        
            <p>Whakaari Management Limited, White Island Tours, Volcanic Air Safaris, Aerius and Kahu NZ are in the court facing fines of up to $1.5 million each and reparations.</p>
        
            <p>GNS Science, the sixth guilty party, will be sentenced separately later this week.</p>
        
            <p>Victims and their family members addressed the court with the last of their impact statements before the hearing moved into its next phase.</p>
        
            <p>Julie Richards and her 20-year-old daughter Jess were two of the 22 people who died in the eruption on 9 December, 2019.</p>
        
            <p>A statement from Julie Richards' sister Barbara Whitehead was read by WorkSafe investigator Casey Broad.</p>
        
            <p>Whitehead described the moment she discovered her sister and niece had died.</p>
        
            <p>"I went to Auckland with my brother, David, and we had DNA tests done," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We were told Jess was in the morgue in Auckland but Julie hadn't been found."</p>

            <p>Whitehead criticised media reporting of the event.</p>
        
            <p>"In the early days the press were awful, even turning up in our driveway," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"My parents were elderly at the time and we tried to shield them from some of the details.</p>
        
            <p>"At one point we did give [the media] photos of Jess and Julie and this was a mistake. When the photos were shown on television my mother saw them and said 'look, there they are... they're fine.'"</p>
        
            <p>Avey Woods, the mother of tour guide Hayden Marshall-Inman who died in the disaster, was the last victim to present a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"When Hayds died on White Island, a piece of me died. You cannot mend a mother's broken heart," she began.</p>
        
            <p>"He nurtured and he was a confidant to his niece, nephews, godchildren... he taught them so much and he still had so much to give."</p>
        
            <p>Woods performed a poem for the court.</p>
        
            <p>"I have been crying today, through my memories," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"As I reach for my son, you look, you say: distraction is a cure for a mum... you do not see this broken heart of mine."</p>
        
            <p>Judge Evangelos Thomas was visibly emotional as Woods concluded her statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Ladies and gentlemen, to all of you who have given so much of yourselves over the last two days... thank you. I'm in awe of that, thank you," Thomas said.</p>
        
            <p>He then called on the audience to stand for a moment of silence before adjourning.</p>
        
            <p>The hearing will continue with a submission from WorkSafe.</p>
