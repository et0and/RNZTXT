            <p>An independent investigation has found a police officer was justified in shooting a man with sponge rounds and did not assault him.</p>
        
            <p>The Armed Offender Squad entered the man's Invercargill property to search it in July last year after a package containing Class A drugs was intercepted</p>
        
            <p>It caused the man to flee into a wooded area with the package which no longer had drugs in it, pursued by the police.</p>
        
            <p>He jumped into a hole in the ground with his back towards the police, and was told to show his hands.</p>
        
            <p>The police state the man was shot in the back twice after refusing to surrender, instead appearing to load a shotgun.</p>
        
            <p>The Independent Police Conduct Authority said it was a reasonable, but mistaken assessment that he had a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>"Although Officer A held a mistaken belief, we accept that it was a reasonable perception of the situation and genuinely held.</p>
        
            <p>"The man was a high-risk offender with a history of firearms convictions; most relevantly, the unlawful possession and reckless discharge of firearms.</p>
        
            <p>"Officer A's stated belief was also held by another officer, and the Taser footage corroborates that the man's movements could reasonably be interpreted in this way."</p>
        
            <p>The authority also investigated the man's claims that his ribs were fractured after officers assaulted him while handcuffed, finding his injuries were not consistent with the medical evidence.</p>
        
            <p>Relieving Southern District Commander acting Superintendent Shona Low said the officers responded appropriately to the situation as they saw it unfolding.</p>
        
            <p>"Our (Armed Offender Squad) staff attending this incident were incredibly professional dealing with a high-risk offender with a history of firearms convictions.</p>
        
            <p>"The officers involved acted quickly to prevent any risk to themselves and their colleagues and to ensure a safe arrest."</p>
