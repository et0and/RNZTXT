            <p>A 13-year-old is among a group of three arrested over erratic driving across Auckland and part of Northland for two hours on Monday evening.</p>
        
            <p>WaitematƒÅ North area prevention manager Senior Sergeant Roger Small said police were told about a stolen vehicle spotted on Worker Road, Wellsford, at around 5.20pm.</p>
        
            <p>"The vehicle was signalled to stop but failed to do so," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police initiated a short pursuit before abandoning [it] due to the manner of driving."</p>
        
            <p>It was then seen driving north on State Highway 1 where it was successfully spiked just north of Onerere Road.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle was dumped north of Glenmore Road and two male occupants were picked up by a grey Ford Ranger with no registration plates. The vehicle had been stolen earlier in the day from a dealership in Manukau, Senior Sergeant Small said.</p>
        
            <p>While it travelled north on SH1 it was tracked by the police Eagle helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger was seen leaving the vehicle in Raumanga.</p>
        
            <p>"The vehicle has then headed southbound back on State Highway 1 until it was spiked at Te Hana.</p>
        
            <p>"At about 7.30pm the vehicle has lost a tyre and the driver has subsequently lost control of the vehicle at Schedeways Hill and crashed."</p>
        
            <p>No-one was injured, Senior Sergeant Small said.</p>
        
            <p>"This was a serious and potentially very dangerous incident, which was thankfully bought to a resolution."</p>
        
            <p>A 15-year-old will appear in North Shore Youth Court, a 22-year-old will appear in North Shore District Court and a 13-year-old was referred to Youth Aid Services.</p>
