            <p>Wellington's train operator Transdev and the Rail Union are meeting Friday morning for bargaining talks as industrial action continues to disrupt services for thousands of commuters.</p>
        
            <p>Since Tuesday, union members have been working to rule, taking all their breaks and refusing overtime or shift changes.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers are again being warned that trains could be cancelled or delayed at short notice.</p>
        
            <p>Limited bus services are available to replace trains.</p>
        
            <p>Some people were stranded for hours after major disruptions on the train network on Wednesday night.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink's Samantha Gain says passengers should keep a close eye on the Metlink website or app to stay informed of service disruptions.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink, which runs the network, said it was encouraging both Transdev and the union to negotiate in good faith and resolve their differences as soon as possible.</p>
        
            <p>Initially bargaining talks were organised for next Thursday but would go ahead on Friday without the mediator.</p>
        
            <p>More talks had been scheduled for Monday, with the mediator as a back-up in case a resolution had not been made.</p>
        
            <p>The industrial dispute is between the train operator Transdev and the Rail and Maritime Transport Union.</p>
