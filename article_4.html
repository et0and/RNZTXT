        <h2>No more height restrictions for Hanmer hydroslides</h2>
        <p>
Although age and weight restrictions remain in place, the two new hydroslides at Hanmer Springs Thermal Pools and Spa mean there are no longer any height restrictions.

            <p>All height restrictions are being removed from the hydroslides at the Hanmer Springs pools in Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>Riders must still be at least five years old, but will no longer need to stand beside a board to check if they are tall enough to hit the 1.2 metre limit.</p>
        
            <p>Hanmer Springs Thermal Pools and Spa marketing manager Shane Adcock said it was fantastic news for visitors.</p>
        
            <p>He said the design of the new Violet Vortex and Waiau Winder slides that opened in October, replacing two 25-year-old rides, allowed the pool to make the call.</p>
        
            <p>"Those two new slides have what we call runout shoots- so they have a shallower pool of water that you finish the ride in, much like our Conical Thrill and SuperBowl rides. Those runout shoots effectively replaced a splashdown pool, which was a deeper pool," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The health and safety risk of landing in a pool at the bottom of a slide is no longer there, and so we felt that we could remove the height restriction that had previously been in place."</p>
        
            <p>Adcock said the slides had been thoroughly tested in terms of managing risks, and the decision also came after recommendations from slide manufacturers.</p>
        
            <p>Age and weight restrictions will remain in place for the four slides.</p>
        
            <p>Adcock said there had been good numbers through the pool this summer, and people had been enjoying the new hydroslides.</p>
        
            <p>"We've had some really good feedback on the new slides, particularly the use of LED lighting through those slides. It's quite a different experience that is certainly not in many areas around New Zealand, if at all."</p>
