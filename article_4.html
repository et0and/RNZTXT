            <p>Police have announced a $100,000 reward for information about the death of a man in West Auckland a decade ago.</p>
        
            <p>Brett Fraser, 51, was killed in October 2014 in the West Auckland home he shared with his flatmate.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to provide answers to Brett's family, and to hold the person or persons responsible for his death to account," Acting Detective Inspector Simon Harrison said.</p>
        
            <p>The reward is on offer until June for information which leads to the identity and conviction of those responsible for Fraser's death.</p>
        
            <p>The Commissioner of Police would determine the amount of the reward and will apportion it if there is more than one claimant.</p>
        
            <p>"Immunity against prosecution will be considered for any accomplice, not being a principal offender, who gives such information or evidence to Police," Harrison said.</p>
        
            <p>Information can be provided to the investigation team on 0800 COLD CASE (0800 2653 2273) or email to Op.Frankfort@police.govt.nz.</p>
