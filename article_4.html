            <p>The terrorist's ability to obtain the guns he used in the Christchurch terror attack will be examined at an inquest.</p>
        
            <p>The second-phase inquest into the massacre of 51 worshippers at Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre in March 2019 will examine firearms laws before the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy Chief Coroner Brigitte Windley will examine how the terrorist came to obtain his firearms licence; whether police should have elicited information which would have led them to reject his application; and whether there were any errors, failures or deficiencies in their assessment.</p>
        
            <p>The coroner's first phase inquest covered 10 issues relating to the events of 15 March 2019 and the response of emergency services to the massacres.</p>
        
            <p>It took just minutes for the terrorist to leave 44 worshippers dead or dying at Al Noor Mosque as he possessed two semi-automatic centrefire rifles, as well as a multitude of high-capacity magazines, two shotguns, a lever-action rifle and a bolt-action rifle.</p>
        
            <p>He then drove to the mosque in Linwood, where he killed seven more people.</p>
        
            <p>Brenton Tarrant was able to obtain a New Zealand's firearms licence after a gaming friend - who was aware of his extremist political opinions and his racist and Islamophobic beliefs - and the friend's father acted as referees for the process.</p>
        
            <p>He had originally planned to use his sister as a referee, but the licensing clerk rejected that possibility as she lived in Australia and could not be interviewed face-to-face.</p>
        
            <p>The terrorist first submitted an application to obtain a firearms licence only 15 days after arriving in New Zealand in August 2017.</p>
        
            <p>At the time of the attacks, he only held a standard A-category licence but by inserting the high-capacity magazines into the semi-automatic centrefire rifles he had turned them into restricted E-category military-style semi-automatic rifles.</p>
        
            <p>The purchase of such high-capacity magazines was unregulated at that time.</p>
        
            <p>Windley will examine this so-called military-style semi-automatic firearm loophole.</p>
        
            <p>She will also address whether police made any "operative errors, failures, or deficiencies" in assessing whether the terrorist was a fit and proper person to hold a firearms licence, under the licensing process as it stood in 2017; whether police could and should have asked the terrorist and his referees questions designed to elicit whether he held extremist political, racist or any other beliefs or views; and on the basis of the process which was taken whether he should have been assessed as a fit and proper person and granted a firearms licence.</p>
        
            <p>The coroner will also examine how firearms licensing laws as they existed in March 2019 contributed to the attack, and take a counterfactual analysis as to whether the terrorist could have obtained a firearms licence and carried out the attack he did if different decisions were made by police and regulators.</p>
        
            <p>The inquest is set down for three weeks, with about 15 witnesses expected to be called.</p>
