            <p>MetService is forecasting a cold but clear Easter weekend for much of New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch woke to its second coldest March temperature on record today at -1C on Friday. Records started in 1954 and the current record is -1.3°C on 18 March 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Blenheim and Wellington also recorded their coldest temperatures of the year at 1C and 7C degrees respectively.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been an unusually cool March," MetService meteorologist Ngaire Wotherspoon said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are looking at further cool temperatures for the rest of Easter.</p>
        
            <p>"We can expect some cold overnight temperatures again, especially for the North Island tonight getting down to 4C and 5C even around Taupō and Whakatāne."</p>
        
            <p>It’s an icy start for southern and central Aotearoa New Zealand. Here are the overnight minimum temps as of 7am Christchurch Airport reached -0.8°C at 6am, their second coldest March temperature since records started in 1954. The current record is -1.3°C on 18 March 2020  pic.twitter.com/6HLRjIZT7m</p>
        
            <p>With the exception of Tai Rāwhiti, most places would begin to see sunny spells from today or tomorrow, Wotherspoon said.</p>
        
            <p>Most of the South Island had single-digit temperatures. The highest temperatures for the morning at 15C were recorded in Auckland and Whangārei.</p>
        
            <p>The first snow of the year had fallen at Otago's Cardrona ski field.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency is warning people to check their heaters before turning it on as temperatures plummet.</p>
        
            <p>Some Serene Classic bathroom heaters have been recalled by WorkSafe because they have started multiple fires.</p>
        
            <p>The MBIE website says the Serene S2068 heaters manufactured in March 2021 "have a manufacturing defect, there have been several fires and overheating events".</p>
        
            <p>"There is a significant risk of people being seriously harmed and property being damaged by fire if the heaters are turned on."</p>
        
            <p>The prohibited S2068 heaters have a serial number in the following ranges:</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said anyone with these heaters "need to have it removed" or to contact one of the recall suppliers.</p>
