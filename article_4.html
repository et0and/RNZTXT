            <p>A Canterbury regional councillor has bemoaned a lack of transparency after the council's chair was reinstated, despite being formally warned for breaching the Resource Management Act.</p>
        
            <p>Peter Scott has resumed his position as chair on Thursday after stepping aside while an independent investigation into his conduct took place.</p>
        
            <p>During an April interview with Newstalk ZB's Heather du Plessis-Allan, Scott admitted his south Canterbury farm had been "operating illegally".</p>
        
            <p>He put the situation down to lengthy delays in receiving advice from Land Information New Zealand (LINZ).</p>
        
            <p>"I'm carrying on and I'm ignoring the fact that I haven't got one," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm operating illegally and I'm the chairman of Environment Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>"I think people get pushed into those corners."</p>
        
            <p>The farm had been in Scott's family for nearly 70 years until it was sold last year.</p>
        
            <p>In 2018, Scott was advised by the council that they would need permission from LINZ to irrigate a 3-hectare area it owned, by obtaining a license to occupy, which delayed the land use consent application being processed.</p>
        
            <p>The investigator passed their findings and recommendations on to the council's regulatory enforcement decision panel to determine the appropriate course of action.</p>
        
            <p>It was decided a fortnight ago, formal warnings would be issued to Scott and two other parties.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement issued following the decision, Scott said the issue had been "regrettable" and "distracting".</p>
        
            <p>"It's a privilege to chair such a focused and talented group of people and I'm looking forward to getting back into the role - we have a lot to do."</p>
        
            <p>Although Scott mostly had the backing of most of his colleagues around the table, councillor for Christchurch South/Ōwhanga Paul Dietsche called for him to step down.</p>
        
            <p>No vote of confidence had been formally moved.</p>
        
            <p>It is understood Scott's ongoing position was discussed "in committee" following Wednesday's council meeting, in which councillor Craig Pauling remained as acting chair.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, a spokesperson for the council confirmed Scott was to remain as chair.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor for Christchurch Central/Ōhoko Greg Byrnes told RNZ he had been left disappointed by the state of affairs.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been a series of more than unfortunate events that have led to this investigation," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm disappointed that councillors haven't been given all of the information.</p>
        
            <p>"I am aware under the RMA, we would normally be privy to all of the details that go through the organisation.</p>
        
            <p>"Given that this has played out so publicly I would've expected to hear all of that stuff."</p>
        
            <p>The panel conceded the situation was "complicated" and involved changes in ownership and lease arrangements, the breach was considered to be at the "lower end of the spectrum".</p>
        
            <p>The independent investigation was estimated to cost $66,000.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors had only seen a "heavily redacted" version of the report, Byrnes said.</p>
        
            <p>"I certainly think it should've been publicly available."</p>
        
            <p>Although the councillor backed his chairman, he described Scott's on air comments as "foolish".</p>
        
            <p>"I'm glad he stepped down for the purposes of the investigation."</p>
        
            <p>He added that the secrecy of the whole saga raised more questions than answers.</p>
        
            <p>"I think there is a definite desire for the community to feel like the appropriate questions have been asked and the appropriate answers have been given.</p>
        
            <p>"I personally think it could've been handled a little better, and a little cheaper."</p>
        
            <p>Councillors agreed on Wednesday to formally adopt policy enabling live streaming of meetings and workshops, once facilities are upgraded.</p>
        
            <p>The move was largely supported around the table, but North Canterbury councillor Claire McKay felt the policy would deter people in running for council.</p>
