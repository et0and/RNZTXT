            <p>Long-running New Zealand current affairs magazine North & South will stop printing for the time being.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, a representative said the decision had been made to hold the print production of the magazine temporarily to focus on developing a "robust digital presence for the brand with every intention to be back early in 2025".</p>
        
            <p>"On the back of flat advertising sales and increasing pressure from advertisers, we have decided it's time to get serious about the digital offering for North & South. There is a lot of equity in the North & South masthead but it is without a digital platform in a digital world."</p>
        
            <p>The magazine was launched in 1986 by Warwick Roger and Robyn Langwell.</p>
        
            <p>It was later bought by German couple Konstantin Richter and Verena Friederike Hasel after the collapse of Bauer media.</p>
        
            <p>It was sold to School Road Publishing last year.</p>
        
            <p>North & South has had a number of editors in recent years, including Rachel Morris and Kirsty Cameron who is now the editor of NZ Listener.</p>
        
            <p>It is understood that sales of the magazine have been challenged.</p>
