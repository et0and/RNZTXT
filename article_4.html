            <p>US lawmakers are considering a bill that would involve New Zealand joining in on military artificial intelligence to beat out China.</p>
        
            <p>What has been dubbed the 'Five AIs Act' is backed by a leading China hawk and ex-US Marine, Republican US Congressman Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin.</p>
        
            <p>The bill if passed would see the US set up a working group among the Five Eyes intelligence network countries, which include New Zealand, to create advanced AI systems.</p>
        
            <p>The aim is for them to compare, test and set up AI systems, and accelerate interoperability for intelligence sharing and "battle space awareness".</p>
        
            <p>"It is imperative that we prevent our adversaries, particularly the Chinese Communist Party, from weaponising AI to advance their military ambitions and perfect their repressive techno-totalitarian surveillance states," Gallagher said on his website.</p>
        
            <p>"The United States cannot allow" a future where Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin became the world leaders in AI," he said.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>The bill is jointly sponsored by a ranking member of the US House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, Democrat Ro Khanna of California.</p>
        
            <p>Washington news website Politico said, "With support from one of the most hard-line Republicans when it comes to China and a progressive Democratic lawmaker, it's likely the bill would see wide support in Congress if taken up."</p>
        
            <p>Khanna said in late November: "I'm proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation ... to ensure that America leads in the 21st century and that we work with our allies to develop a strategy to advance the benefits of AI while preparing for any potential threats in the future."</p>
        
            <p>Gallagher said the bill would ensure AI was dominated by the Five Eyes Alliance "who share a common mission and shared strategy to use AI for good".</p>
        
            <p>The bill suggests the cross-country working group would leverage commercially available AI tech to rapidly boost the military and intelligence sectors.</p>
        
            <p>Gallagher chairs the powerful US House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
        
            <p>The committee has just heard from former Australian security adviser John Garnaut warning that, through TikTok alone, China has the potential for "radically reshaping" global public opinion.</p>
        
            <p>Defence Minister Judith Collins said the government is aware of the proposed legislation and is seeking more information via the US Embassy in Washington.</p>
        
            <p>"In general terms, we welcome opportunities to investigate the benefits of AI while limiting its risks," she said to RNZ in a statement.</p>
