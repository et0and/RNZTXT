            <p>A Covid-19 vaccine that can fight newer strains of the virus will be rolled out from next month.</p>
        
            <p>Pharmac's director of pharmaceuticals Geraldine MacGibbon said the drug funding agency had approved the transition to the updated Covid-19 vaccine for the XBB.1.5 strain from 7 March.</p>
        
            <p>"We've secured stock of the XBB Covid-19 vaccine and are pleased to have it available for New Zealanders. The XBB vaccine is more effective against more recent subvariants of Covid-19 in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>The director of public health for Health New Zealand Te Whatu Ora Nick Chamberlain urged anyone who was eligible to get vaccinated.</p>
        
            <p>Covid-19 was not a seasonal illness and cases had risen over summer, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you're eligible, you can get a vaccination if it's been at least six months since your last Covid-19 vaccine or if you have never had one before. It's recommended that you wait at least six months since your last Covid-19 infection."</p>
