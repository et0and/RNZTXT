            <p>Strong winds at a massive fire in the Canterbury high country have not caused any breakouts today, Fire and Emergency says.</p>
        
            <p>The Bridge Hill blaze, which started on Thursday morning, has burnt through nearly a thousand hectares of land, northwest of Springfield.</p>
        
            <p>The incident controller of the fire, Colin Russell, said the fire had not grown in size in the last two days, and was contained within its boundary.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a good team effort from everyone involved today and we've quickly got on top of any flare-ups we have seen," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Russell said the wind had created dust storms across the fire ground due to the lack of vegetation, which had reduced visibility for motorists on State Highway 73.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd urge everyone to take extra care when driving on the road, as they have been doing since the road was reopened with traffic restrictions," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The worst winds, with gusts of up to 150km/h, were forecast for overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Russell said Fire and Emergency would have a drone team and ground crews on site to monitor the perimeter of the fire for hotspots.</p>
        
            <p>"If we make it through tonight with no significant breakouts then we are hoping to reduce the number of resources on the fire ground tomorrow," he said.</p>
        
            <p>About 100 people worked on the fire ground today.</p>
