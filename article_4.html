            <p>The trial of an Auckland woman allegedly killed by her husband has heard he switched between crying and emotionlessness as he spoke to a family friend after his wife's death.</p>
        
            <p>It is the third week of the trial of Philip Polkinghorne, who is accused of murdering Pauline Hanna in April 2021 at their Remuera home, and then staging it as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, a long time friend of Hanna Victoria (Pheasant) Riordan, told the court that Hanna told her more than a year before her death Polkinghorne had attempted to strangle her.</p>
        
            <p>Both Victoria Riordan and her husband, John Riordan, said they had been concerned about Hanna's wellbeing and her relationship with Polkinghorne.</p>
        
            <p>Hanna had stayed at the couple's home in the early 1990s when she studied at the University of Auckland, and also was a bridesmaid at their wedding.</p>
        
            <p>John Riordan has returned to the witness stand on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Under examination from Crown prosecutor Alysha McClintock, Riordan said his wife text messaged Polkinghorne the day after Hanna's death, "thinking of you," after which they received a phone call from him.</p>

            <p>He recalled Polkinghorne said: "My darling wife, she's gone" and he started crying.</p>
        
            <p>He said Polkinghorne talked for a few minutes with "the same level of emotion", but that the emotion ceased abruptly when he started talking about the police investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"The second that he starts talking about the police, the crying has stopped, like there is no emotion in his voice whatsoever," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He said the police are going to charge me with murder, I didn't kill my wifeâ€¦ there were other words said and then he went back to talking about Pauline and the crying started immediately on talking about Pauline" he said.</p>
        
            <p>When asked by McClintock what Riordan and his wife were doing as they listened to Polkinghorne, he said they looked at each other and he said: "it didn't feel real".</p>
        
            <p>Riordan said the last time he saw Hanna was in February 2021, at the funeral of Hanna's mother.</p>
        
            <p>She had talked about her two grandchildren, through her stepchildren with Philip.</p>
        
            <p>"She was so excited about that whole process and being part of their lives growing up, she had a lot to live for," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
