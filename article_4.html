            <p>Two people are in custody after a report someone had a gun inside a car led to armed police swarming an Auckland suburb.</p>
        
            <p>The incident began unfolding just before 1pm Thursday in Western Springs.</p>
        
            <p>"A member of the public reported that they had sighted what appeared to be a firearm inside a vehicle on Great North Road," police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Two men were inside the vehicle, and it has been driven away at speed."</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle was seen being "driven dangerously" along Carrington Road in Point Chevalier, police said.</p>
        
            <p>It was tracked to Herdman Street in Waterview, with the police Eagle helicopter assisting the operation.</p>
        
            <p>Photos from the scene showed armed police and about seven cars on the street.</p>
        
            <p>Police cordoned off the street and arrested a man "without further incident", the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>Another person was also taken into custody.</p>
        
            <p>A firearm was also located and recovered without incident, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said charges were being considered.</p>
