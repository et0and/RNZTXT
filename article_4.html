        <h2>Inside Wellington's nearly $400m sewage sludge treatment plant</h2>
        <p>
A new levy will be introduced to ratepayers to cover the cost of the facility that aims to process sludge into a safe, non-odorous and stable product.
</p>
        
            <p>The new sewage sludge treatment plant in the suburb of Moa Point in Wellington has been named Te Whare Wai Para Nuku.</p>
        
            <p>Construction began in May 2023, and is expected to be completed in June 2026.</p>
        
            <p>It is being built by Wellington City Council joint venture construction partners HEB and McConnell Dowell Construction.</p>

            <p>The plant would reduce the amount of sewage sludge created through the wastewater treatment process and turn it into a safe, reusable product, Wellington City Council project director Janet Molyneux said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are building, what will be, a world-class facility that is going to be a game changer for the way that sludge byproduct of wastewater treatment is handled and dealt with in one facility, and in New Zealand," she said.</p>

            <p>She said the facility would reduce the volume of sludge created by 80 percent, and would reduce carbon emissions by 60 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, more than a million litres of sludge is piped 9km across the city to the Southern Landfill, where it is dewatered, and 40 to 50 tonnes is buried.</p>

            <p>The new facility will use thermal hydrolysis and digestion and a thermal dryer to process sludge into a safe, non-odorous and stable product.</p>
        
            <p>That product will have the potential to be used productively, including as a soil conditioner and fuel for industrial heat.     </p>
        
            <p>HEB water and wastewater manager and project director Peter Hodgson said the process was popular across Europe, North America and Asia. </p>
        
            <p>"There are about 110 plants with advanced wastewater treatment around the world, but this is the first New Zealand," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"As far as a single site, complex wastewater job, this would be one of the biggest in the last 20 years."</p>

            <p>McConnell Dowell construction manager Richard Atkin said the build has been "quite challenging".</p>
        
            <p>"It's the first of its kind in New Zealand that's been built, and it's got a very high seismic loading, so the structure work is quite complex," he said.</p>
        
            <p>From August, a new levy will be introduced to all ratepayers to cover the $370 million cost of Te Whare Wai Para Nuku.</p>
