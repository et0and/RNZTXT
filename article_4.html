            <p>Content warning: This story mentions suicide </p>
        
            <p>A rope at the scene of Pauline Hanna's death was too loose to have been used for suicide, a detective says.</p>
        
            <p>The High Court murder trial of former eye surgeon Philip Polkinghorne resumed for a third day on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne stands accused of murdering his wife, Hanna, in their Remuera home on 5 April 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown argues Polkinghorne's financial situation, drug use and infidelity contributed to an aggressive outburst.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the former surgeon's defence team claims Hanna hanged herself, though the Crown believed the scene had only been staged to look like a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Taking the witness stand on Wednesday, detective Ilona Walton described her first impression of the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne had covered Hanna's body with a duvet. "As I walked up to the duvet I could see an arm and some hair sticking out of it," Walton said.</p>
        
            <p>"I went past Hanna upstairs... I saw the orange rope tied to the balustrade at the top. I noticed there was a short portion of the rope hanging below the landing... part of it was frayed like it had been cut, but it was in otherwise good condition."</p>
        
            <p>After taking several photos of the scene, she approached her fellow police officer Christian Iogha to remove the rope.</p>
        
            <p>"He then performed a tension check on the rope ... and it very quickly unraveled," she revealed.</p>
        
            <p>"He gently pulled it and it started to come down... a gentle, light pull. It didn't just stop when he pulled it, it kept unraveling and coming undone," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not in line with how we would normally expect a ligature of a person who has hung themself to react. It seemed unusual, and not normal that the rope would unravel in that manner."</p>
        
            <p>She also described the garage, where two white Mercedes were parked.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the vehicles had its boot open. One with a personalised registration: 'RETINA'."</p>
        
            <p>Walton corroborated previous reports that Polkinghorne appeared to have a forehead wound.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a small shallow cut to his forehead. Horizontal, maybe about one to two centimetres."</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
