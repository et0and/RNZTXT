            <p>Auckland Transport (AT) is starting to remove several rail crossings in the city to reduce the risk of death on the train network.</p>
        
            <p>Seven rail crossings will be removed in the first stage of a programme that aims to make the network safer ahead of the City Rail Link (CRL).</p>
        
            <p>AT public transport infrastructure development group manager Christian Messelyn said with more trains intended to operate at high frequencies with the new rail link, safety was a priority.</p>
        
            <p>"The majority of level crossings in Auckland already have the highest possible safety mitigations available in New Zealand. These include automatic pedestrian gates, however an increasing number of pedestrian near-miss incidents have been recorded with people misusing these safety gates."</p>
        
            <p>"When CRL opens, in some places the train frequencies will increase significantly, which means crossing barrier arms and gates will be closed more regularly, and this can result in people getting frustrated and taking risks.</p>
        
            <p>He said AT would be working with communities affected by the closure.</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate that removing these crossings will mean that our communities who use them frequently will need to use alternative routes, and we've been closely engaging with these communities since June 2023 to understand how alternative routes can be improved.</p>
        
            <p>"In some areas that means installing better lighting, widening and improving footpaths, and installing new signage along these alternative walking routes. Inclusive access via the alternative routes following the closure of the level crossings will reduce the impact on users and provide broader active mode benefits."</p>
        
            <p>AT had introduced a level crossing removal programme across the city to ensure it received regulatory approval to increase train services.</p>
        
            <p>Messelyn said the works needed to start now.</p>
        
            <p>"Work on the level crossings is necessary to support the testing and commissioning of CRL which will begin later this year, and the future timetables that we intend to operate.</p>
        
            <p>"As the testing and commissioning programme progresses, our customers will see an increasing number of trains as we get closer to day one."</p>
        
            <p>In addition to the removal of the level crossings, AT would be completing improvements at other level crossings across Auckland ahead of the CRL, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our focus is to keep people safe with alternative routes, understand how these will work for the communities that will use them, and ensure we maximise all the benefits of CRL when it opens by enabling more frequent services to operate."</p>
        
            <p>Two crossings, Corban Estate in Henderson and Tironui Station Rd East, Takanini, closed in February.</p>
        
            <p>As for the Lloyd Ave crossing in Mount Albert, AT said it had started to work on improving the alternative route prior to removing the level crossing.</p>
        
            <p>At the crossing at Kingdon Street in Newmarket, AT was engaging with local businesses on the plans to improve the alternative route, and the timing of the crossing closure.</p>
        
            <p>For the crossings at O'Neills Road in Swanson and Homai Station, AT said it was assessing community feedback.</p>
        
            <p>"While these crossings have been identified for removal ahead of City Rail Link, it is envisaged that all rail crossings on the network will need to be removed progressively in the next 10-20 years or as funding allows," Messelyn said.</p>
