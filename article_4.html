            <p>It is a relief New Zealand pilot Phillip Mehrtens was freed before Indonesia's new president took power, West Papua Action Aotearoa spokesperson Catherine Delahunty says.</p>

            <p>Mehrtens was released after 19 months in captivity in West Papua, Indonesia, on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The armed faction of the West Papua National Liberation Army kidnapped Merhtens in February 2023 after he landed a small commercial plane in a remote, mountainous area.</p>

            <p>"This has been such a long and difficult ordeal for him and his family. We're all really worried about whether it would be possible. Getting him free was a series of very delicate negotiations," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of them have started and stumbled and not led to anything. It's a great relief that he is free. And I think one of the things that was important to people over there is they really wanted to get this resolved before the new president of Indonesia, who he has a terrible reputation associated with his military career before he became president. And they have achieved that.</p>
        
            <p>"And as far as I know, there was no bloodshed."</p>
