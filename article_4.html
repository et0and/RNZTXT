            <p>Police are assessing the weather at Aoraki Mount Cook to decide whether search efforts for three missing climbers can resume on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The climbers, attempting to reach the mountain summit, were reported missing after they didn't meet their prearranged transport on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>A helicopter and search and rescue teams were unable to find the group on Monday afternoon before bad weather halted the search.</p>
        
            <p>Veteran mountaineer Chris Prudden said storms coming off the Tasman Sea could create dangers.</p>
        
            <p>"That weather moves up and can hang on the main divide area and provide a lot of hazard, its not unusual for people to be caught out," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the search would resume when conditions allowed.</p>
