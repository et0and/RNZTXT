            <p>The Bluebridge ferry that lost power in the Cook Strait last week is still detained while Maritime NZ determines whether it is safe to sail again.</p>
        
            <p>The Connemara blacked out after leaving Wellington last Thursday night and drifted for more than two hours off the south coast before being rescued by tug boats.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime NZ placed it under a detention notice the next day, and that was still in place, it told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"Considerations are still be worked through with Bluebridge around the lifting of the detention notice, and the vessel's return to service plan."</p>
        
            <p>A number of things had to be ticked off for the vessel to return to service, it said.</p>
        
            <p>That included identifying the loss of power and fixing the problem, conducting sea trials, ensuring the country the ship is registered in - The Bahamas - is comfortable it is safe, and fulfilling any requirements placed on it by harbourmasters.</p>
        
            <p>"Once Maritime NZ receives these assurances from the parties, and an inspection showed no obvious breaches of international conventions, we will release it from detention."</p>
        
            <p>Sea trials were completed on Thursday, but the ferry was not in service on Friday, with Bluebridge cancelling its sailings.</p>
        
            <p>"The Connemara has returned to the Bluebridge berth in Wellington and an inspection of the ship by Maritime New Zealand is continuing," Bluebridge said on its website.</p>
        
            <p>"Safety is our highest priority, and we are working through the required process to ensure the problem experienced by Connemara is rectified, and the ship can return to service when ready."</p>
