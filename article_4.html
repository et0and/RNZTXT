            <p>Central government needs to step in to ensure the rebuild of Christ Church Cathedral is completed, Christchurch Mayor Phil Mauger says.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year the Anglican Church announced the Christ Church Cathedral Reinstatement Project could be mothballed as the cost of the rebuild blew out to almost $250 million, leaving a $114 million budget shortfall.</p>
        
            <p>Following a six-hour synod, the church agreed to lower seismic strengthening and scrapping some elements of the original plan, which cut the shortfall to $85 million.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, Christchurch City Council would discuss releasing $7 million of funding to the project. Mauger told RNZ that should be a formality.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a targeted rate for $10 million. We've given them three, we owe them seven, we should give them that seven because that was part of it. Some people will say 'no, you shouldn't because it was to be given right at the finish'. We've collected that seven on the pretext that we're giving it to the cathedral, so that should be done."</p>
        
            <p>Mauger described the cathedral as the "last missing piece" in the city's rebuild and central government was needed to get the project over the line.</p>
        
            <p>"The main thing is to get it finished so that people can enjoy it," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"But the other thing is, we can't do anything unless the government come to the party. And from what I understand, [the project team have] been working very closely with the government and it'll be interesting to see what it comes out with."</p>
        
            <p>A decision was expected in September, Mauger said.</p>
        
            <p>Christ Church Cathedral Reinstatement Project campaign director Carolyne Grant confirmed an approach was made to the government.</p>
        
            <p>"Discussions have taken place and are ongoing, with nothing formal to release at this stage."</p>
        
            <p>Treasury said it would ultimately be a matter for Cabinet.</p>
        
            <p>"We can confirm that the Christ Church Reinstatement Project has written to the government requesting additional funding towards the Cathedral reinstatement. Cabinet will consider the request," a Treasury spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Mauger told RNZ council could not provide any more funding for the project without consulting with the community.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't do anything. If we were going to extend that $10 million targeted rate, we'd have to consult on that because we'd get shot."</p>
        
            <p>Original estimates put the completion date at 2031, but the church had said the cathedral's completion was still not guaranteed until the $85 million shortfall was filled.</p>
        
            <p>That shortfall assumed further fundraising and a contribution from the church. A proposal to inject $16.2 million by selling off church land and buildings was also agreed at June's synod.</p>
