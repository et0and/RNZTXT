            <p>Christchurch residents have been jolted by a shallow earthquake for the second time on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>A 3.5 magnitude tremor struck at a depth of 4km south west of Christchurch at 5.45pm.</p>
        
            <p>More than 4300 reported feeling the quake on GeoNet's website, with most describing it as light or weak.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after another earthquake on Saturday at 10.20am, which was initially measured at magnitude 3.4 by GeoNet, but was also only 4km underground.</p>
        
            <p>It was centred to the south west of Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Within 15 minutes of the quake, more than 2800 people had made reports to GeoNet saying they had felt the shaking, with most describing it as light or weak, but a smattering experiencing it as moderate or strong.</p>
