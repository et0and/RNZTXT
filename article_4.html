            <p>Fluoride will be reintroduced into Hastings' water supply from next week after an eight-year hiatus, following the Havelock North water crisis.</p>
        
            <p>Four people died and 5000 people fell ill after the town's water supply was contaminated with campylobacter in 2016.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings District Council stopped adding fluoride to allow for the addition of chlorine for water safety.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, it was not possible to add both - but that has changed thanks to recent infrastructure upgrades.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings' water had been fluoridated since the 1950s, and a public vote in 2013 supported its use, mayor Sandra Hazlehurst said.</p>
        
            <p>"It has always been council's intention to re-introduce fluoride, alongside chlorine once our new water storage and treatment facilities were completed," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This has since been reinforced by a clear directive from the Ministry of Health to resume fluoridation."</p>
        
            <p>In July 2022, Director General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield directed 14 councils, including Hastings District Council, to add fluoride to their water supplies.</p>
        
            <p>From next week, fluoride will be reintroduced to the main urban water supply which provides water to Hastings, Havelock North, Flaxmere, Bridge Pa and Pakipaki.</p>
        
            <p>But the council was not required to add fluoride to the smaller community drinking water supplies "at this stage", it said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>A supply of non-chlorinated water without added fluoride was available at the community drinking water station in Hastings Civic Square, it said.</p>
