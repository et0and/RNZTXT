        <h2>Pharmacists can now vaccinate children under 5</h2>
        <p>
From Monday, tamariki can get all their free childhood vaccinations from pharmacists in a bid to boost lagging immunisation rates.

            <p>Parents of small children can now get them vaccinated at the pharmacy.</p>
        
            <p>From Monday, pharmacists are permitted to give vaccines to children under five - something they were already allowed to do for older children and adults.</p>
        
            <p>University of Auckland academic and Immunisation Advisory Centre director Nikki Turner said the number of people taking up the opportunity was expected to be small to start with.</p>
        
            <p>Immunising small children was quite different to immunising adults, and pharmacists would take some time to upskill.</p>
        
            <p>However, the change in rules would make childhood immunisations more accessible over time, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora Health NZ sought the rule change to try and boost lagging immunisation rates.</p>
        
            <p>It asked for pharmacists to be allowed to vaccinate babies from six weeks of age for all the free childhood immunisations on the New Zealand vaccination schedule.</p>
        
            <p>Immunisation rates were the lowest they had been in years, it previously told Pharmac, at 83 percent for the general population and 70 percent for tamariki Māori.</p>
        
            <p>Immunisation Advisory Centre general manager Loretta Roberts said the move would make it easier for those struggling to afford or book a doctor's appointment.</p>
        
            <p>"Pharmacies are open often longer hours, on weekends as well so it will give an opportunity for people to find another time to get their children immunised," she said.</p>
        
            <p>It was also expected to help families in remote areas.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very difficult at times to get into GPs, so it gives another access opportunity especially where we've got a lot of patients where we don't have a large number of GPs."</p>
        
            <p>Pharmacists who had decided to offer vaccinations for under-fives had completed extra training administered by the centre, Roberts said.</p>
        
            <p>It was important that whānau still enrolled their child with a GP so they could receive routine health checks, among other support, Turner said.</p>
        
            <p>"This should not be an isolated issue just to go to a pharmacist, it's really important our children are enrolled and have a good relationship with their general practice - it's absolutely vital."</p>
