        <h2>University's enrolments slump for third year</h2>
        <p>
More students are dropping out after their first year, and fewer are signing up in the first place, the university says.

            <p>Enrolments at the University of Otago have fallen for the third year in a row.</p>
        
            <p>The university has around 17,600 full-time equivalent students - or 2 percent fewer than at the same time last year.</p>
        
            <p>The drop was mostly due to fewer domestic students returning for a second year of study, but there were also fewer first-year domestic students. The faculties of Humanities and Sciences both saw fewer enrolments.</p>
        
            <p>University of Otago acting vice-chancellor Professor Helen Nicholson said the university had expected a decline in domestic enrolments this year, but it was larger than expected, and there were not enough international students to offset it.</p>
        
            <p>"In the international sphere we have seen pleasing increases in single semester study abroad and postgraduate coursework enrolments," Professor Nicholson said.</p>
        
            <p>"On the other hand, we have had some challenges with late-arriving internationals due in some instances to delays with the issuing of visas."</p>
        
            <p>Once Semester Two enrolments had been confirmed, the University was looking at a shortfall between $3 million and $5 million - but this was an improvement on last year's $20m budget hole and "most, if not all" of the sum could be absorbed centrally, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Otago signalled job cuts when it reported a small drop in enrolments of 0.9 percent, blaming the "cumulative impact of ongoing Covid-19 disruption, the rising cost of study and a buoyant job market".</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, enrolments at the University of Waikato have risen 6 percent, with international enrolments up 25 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The number of postgraduate students was up 16 percent on last year, while first year figures have stayed the same despite fewer Year 13 students achieving University Entrance.</p>
        
            <p>University of Waikato vice-chancellor Professor Neil Quigley said the number of students transferring from elsewhere was up by 19 percent.</p>
        
            <p>"The demand for healthcare professionals is driving enrolment growth, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, especially with the prospect of a new Waikato Medical School.</p>
        
            <p>"We have had notable enrolment increases for the Bachelor of Nursing and Master of Nursing Practice qualifications."</p>
        
            <p>Enrolments continued to be strong in Waikato's te reo MƒÅori immersion programme, Te Tohu Paetahi, with a 20 percent increase overall.</p>
        
            <p>The figures come as universities watch enrolments closely as they try to recover from their worst year on record.</p>
        
            <p>The sector made its first-ever collective financial loss in 2023 after a drop in domestic enrolments forced some institutions to cut staff and courses.</p>
        
            <p>As a result, the previous government bailed out the cash-strapped tertiary institutions, investing an extra $128 million on top of the 5 percent funding increase in the 2023 Budget.</p>
        
            <p>Tertiary Education Commission figures drawn from university annual reports showed Massey, Victoria and Otago had some common features - last year they had more staff relative to students than before the pandemic began and those staff were costing their institutions more at the same time as income was falling.</p>
        
            <p>Those three universities saw staff go through voluntary redundancies and layoffs, and certain subjects - such as natural and social sciences - were severely cut or dropped altogether.</p>
