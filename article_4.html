            <p>Police are investigating after a man died following an interaction with police at an Auckland City Mission site.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Superintendent Sunny Patel told the Herald investigations are under way after the man fell and struck his head following the interaction with police on 4 November.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City Mission's Jacqui Dillon confirmed to the Herald the man who died was known to them and used their services.</p>
        
            <p>The man was at an Auckland City Mission food distribution and support centre on Boston Rd, Grafton, prior to the incident, Dillon said.</p>
        
            <p>Police also confirmed the incident occured after they were called to a commercial property on Boston Rd.</p>
        
            <p>However, Dillon said the mission had no further details about the incident.</p>
        
            <p>The Independent Police Conduct Authority has been notified. Police have also launched a critical incident investigation to figure out the full circumstances surrounding the incident.</p>
        
            <p>The Herald has also been told by an anonymous source the man who died was homeless.</p>
        
            <p>Patel said police were called to a commercial property on Boston Rd, Grafton after a report a man had "become agitated towards staff at the address and paramedics".</p>
        
            <p>"Police officers arrived and instructed the man to leave," Patel said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are still working to establish exactly what has taken place. However, following this, the man has fallen and suffered a serious head injury."</p>
        
            <p>The man was taken to hospital where he had surgery, Patel said.</p>
        
            <p>The man has since died in hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"Our sympathies are with the man's family and friends at this time, and we are providing support to the man's family," Patel said.</p>
