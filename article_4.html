            <p>An elderly man has been critically injured in a suspicious house fire in Stokes Valley, Lower Hutt.</p>
        
            <p>Police have said it is believed the fire is linked to two past fires at the same block of flats on 10 and 14 October.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services, including fire crews from five stations, were called to the property on Hanson Grove just after 3am on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>One person , an 81-year-old man was taken to hospital in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>The area was cordoned off, and police were working with Fire and Emergency to examine the scene.</p>

            <p>The fire is the third at the block of flats in a month, Detective Inspector Haley Ryan said, and all three had been lit in the early hours of the morning.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in Stokes Valley say they were shocked by the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>A neighbour said he was kept up half the night after he saw the flames coming from the building. He described the occupant of the home as a recluse.</p>
        
            <p>Another local said they knew the person through their son's father.</p>
        
            <p>"He's cool as, he's a giving person," they said.</p>
        
            <p>They said the neighbourhood was close-knit but the area had experienced other fires in recent years.</p>
        
            <p>"It's buzzy because we've had a few fires around here too. Pretty sad for the families though."</p>
        
            <p>They said they were unsure if the home would be repaired or rebuilt.</p>
        
            <p>"The house down on [nearby] George Street that got burnt down isn't getting [rebuilt] at all."</p>
        
            <p>Kāinga Ora's regional director for Greater Wellington Vicki McLaren confirmed the block where the man lived was owned by the housing provider.</p>
        
            <p>Front-line teams had been in contact with other residents in the apartment block "to offer support at this difficult time," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who may have CCTV of the fire or who witnessed the incident should get in touch with police, Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even the smallest piece of information could prove vital in our investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have CCTV footage from dashcam, residential or commercial premises in any areas of Stokes Valley, witnessed any three of the fires, or were in the area at the time of the fires, even if you didn't witness the incidents please contact us."</p>
        
            <p>Information could be reported at 105, using the reference number 241105/2249 and quote Operation SOVE.</p>
