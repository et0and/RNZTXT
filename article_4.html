            <p>A Nelson roundabout that has been the site of 26 crashes in 10 years is set to receive a $1 million upgrade to improve pedestrian and cycle safety.</p>
        
            <p>Four raised crossings will be installed at the intersection of Toi Toi Street and St Vincent Street in the suburb of Victory, after was it was identified in the NZTA Waka Kotahi safety programme as an area with a crash rate that needed addressing.</p>
        
            <p>Two of the 26 crashes at the intersection in the 10 years to 2021 resulted in serious injury. Eight of the crashes involved cyclists and one a pedestrian.</p>
        
            <p>Pierre Hammond was hit by a car at the roundabout while cycling through it in June 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't use the roundabout anymore. I was incredibly lucky it was only a small vehicle that could stop quickly once the driver realised I was there, but it still knocked me off my bike and crushed my back wheel. I was wearing high vis, had lights on my bike and checked both ways, she just didn't see me."</p>
        
            <p>He said the upgrade will save lives and make the area much safer.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson mayor Nick Smith said improving the road design in areas where crashes frequently occurred was a council priority.</p>
        
            <p>"This Victory roundabout is an accident black spot and heavily used by residents, commuters, children and cyclists travelling between central Nelson and the Railway Reserve.</p>
        
            <p>"The new crossings will go a long way towards improving the safety of the roundabout. The measures have long been called for by the Victory community and I am pleased this project is getting underway."</p>
        
            <p>Victory Primary School tumuaki Dan George also welcomed the roundabout upgrade.</p>
        
            <p>"As a community-centred school, we fully tautoko any initiative that helps keep our tamariki and community safe. Many of our children walk, bike, or scooter to kura and the new crossings will give them more confidence in doing so. It's a big thumbs-up from us and we're very grateful."</p>
        
            <p>KidsCrossing Nelson Whakatu Facebook page administrator and safe travel advocate Andrea Warn said Victory had many residents who did not drive, so their only form of transport was walking or cycling, and this roundabout was unsafe to cross.</p>
        
            <p>Council acting group infrastructure manager David Light said raised crossings were chosen for this project because they offered both pedestrian safety and traffic calming benefits.</p>
        
            <p>"Raised crossings act as a physical reminder for drivers to slow down. These raised platforms, which have zebra crossings marked on top, give pedestrians and cyclists the right of way."</p>
        
            <p>In addition, the footpath around the south side of the intersection will be extended and concrete islands will be installed in the medians of each road.</p>
        
            <p>The work will begin next week and is expected to take three months to complete, with road closures in place while the work is carried out.</p>
