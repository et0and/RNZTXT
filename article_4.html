            <p>Interislander says the ferry Aratere will be brought back into port today while an investigation into the stranding continues.</p>
        
            <p>The Interislander vessel lost its steering and ran aground near the port on Friday, before being refloated last night.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander executive general manager Duncan Roy says divers have checked the hull and found it is still water tight, and there appears to be minimal damage to the vessel.</p>
        
            <p>TheTransport Accident Investigation Commission and Maritime New Zealand will start investigating onboard the Aratere once it returns to Picton Wharf, he said.</p>
