            <p>World Vision New Zealand estimates nearly $8 billion worth of goods associated with child and forced labour were imported in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>It said that means households spent an average of $77 a week on goods linked to modern slavery.</p>
        
            <p>These so-called "risky goods" are most often clothes and electronics imported from countries like China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia.</p>
        
            <p>But the humanitarian charity said the goods can also include bananas, coffee, toys and furniture.</p>
        
            <p>Spokesperson Rebekah Armstrong told RNZ the report used official import data and a US government method of assessing risk to make the estimates. She said the estimates were conservative and were likely higher in reality.</p>
        
            <p>To address the problem, World Vision wanted the incoming government to legislate against modern slavery within its first 100 days in power.</p>
        
            <p>Armstrong said the law should go further than businesses simply disclosing where "risky goods" were from and what they were.</p>
        
            <p>"We want the government to introduce due diligence legislation, which means that companies have to identify, address and mitigate modern slavery in their supply chain".</p>
        
            <p>She said the former Labour government was working on disclosure legislation. But reviews of modern slavery laws internationally showed disclosure alone does not effectively tackle the problem, Armstrong said.</p>
