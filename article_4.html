            <p>The lever has been pulled for the final time on New Zealand's last railway signal box.</p>
        
            <p>After 89 years the manual signal box in Wellington, which controls train movement on the tracks, is gone, and has been replaced by a computerised system already adopted by the rest of the country.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail chief of capital David Gordon said the upgrade was part of several changes to the Wellington junction that would allow for more trains on the network - slated to be in service in five years' time.</p>
        
            <p>He said entry to the station had for almost 90 years been controlled by "people standing in a signal box pulling levers".</p>
        
            <p>"So the job that was previously done by looking out the window, is now done by looking at a screen in Wallaceville."</p>
        
            <p>Gordon said the digital signalling also built redundancy into the system, with the screens in the Hutt Valley duplicated in Auckland, which could be used in case of emergency.</p>
        
            <p>He said while the manual system was still used in many parts of the world - including London's underground - it was not versatile.</p>
        
            <p>"It is so incredibly reliable, provided you don't want to change it, but it only does one job.</p>
        
            <p>"Whereas computer-based technology you can reprogramme."</p>
        
            <p>Gordon said Kiwirail was considering what it would do with the manual levers and suspected they could end up in a heritage museum, but no decision had been made just yet.</p>
        
            <p>He said the signal box upgrade and addition of more than 20 turntables was necessary to open up the entry to Wellington Station, which was "critically constrained".</p>
        
            <p>"We've spread the junction out so trains have got a bit more of a safety overlap and we've dealt with the signalling. So, what was a restriction on the network is now gone.</p>
        
            <p>"Those [future] services were not going to be possible had we not done this work."</p>
        
            <p>Gordon said the upgrades were among a series of maintenance projects that shut down Wellington's railway network over the Christmas break.</p>
        
            <p>He said despite the abysmal weather most of work was complete and all train lines - except Wairarapa - were back up and running on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Gordon said the upgrades to the Remutaka Tunnel were on schedule and expected Wairarapa train services to resume on 10 February.</p>
