            <p>A rescue boat was sent to retrieve the person, who was unconscious when they were pulled out of the water.</p>
        
            <p>The lifeguards immediately attempted to resuscitate the person once the were taken to shore just after midday.</p>
        
            <p>"Surf lifeguards commenced CPR and then responded with a defibrillator. Police, ambulance and FENZ also responded to the incident, however, the patient was unable to be resuscitated," SLSNZ said.</p>
