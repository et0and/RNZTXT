            <p>Greater Wellington councillors have agreed to increase Metlink public transport fares by 10 percent from 1 July 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink group manager Samantha Gain said in a report before that council estimated that without the fares increase, a rates rise of 3.3 percent would be needed to cover public transport costs, expected to climb by 19 percent in the next financial year.</p>
        
            <p>Approximately a third of Metlink funding comes from fares, the rest from the government and regional council rates.</p>
        
            <p>The council also confirmed that free travel for under 13-year-olds and half-price fares for under 25-year-olds would end on 1 May 2024, in line with the government's decision to withdraw funding for these concessions.</p>
        
            <p>Children under five will continue to be able to travel for free with Metlink, and half-priced fares will remain for passengers holding Community Services Cards through the government's Community Connect scheme.</p>
        
            <p>The 75 percent discount on Total Mobility taxi services for Total Mobility Card holders will also continue, as will half-price off-peak fares for all passengers.</p>
