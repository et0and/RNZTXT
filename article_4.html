            <p>Police have launched a homicide investigation and arrested a person after the death of a man in the Far North last night.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services, including police, were called to a property on Iwitaua Road, Mangamuka at about 9pm on Sunday after reports of a person being stabbed at the address.</p>
        
            <p>The man was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Northland CIB detective inspector Al Symonds said a 50-year-old man was arrested nearby and was assisting police with their inquiries.</p>
        
            <p>"We know this will have been a shock to the community, however we would like to reassure people that this appears to be an isolated incident.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a tragic situation and we are ensuring there is support in place for those closest to the victim."</p>
        
            <p>He said an increased police presence would remain in the area while a scene examination was completed.</p>
        
            <p>Symonds said police were continuing to make enquiries but was encouraging anyone with information to get in touch through its 105 number or provide information online referencing the file number 240304/6284.</p>
