            <p>The three men accused of murdering an Auckland teenager have been granted name suppression and remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>Then 19-year-old Jayden Mamfredos-Nair went missing in April of last year.</p>
        
            <p>He was last seen alive getting into a vehicle with two members of the Head Hunters gang.</p>
        
            <p>Police arrested a 20-year-old male and two 26-year-old males at the weekend, charging them with the teen's murder, after a body - believed to be Mamfredos-Nair - was found at a Dairy Flat property.</p>
        
            <p>Officers had been searching the property since Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>In the North Shore District Court on Monday morning, a number of police officers were present as the victim's family, and supporters of the accused looked on.</p>
        
            <p>As the first of the three left the dock, yelling could be heard from the public gallery, saying goodbye.</p>
        
            <p>One person in the gallery put up a hand sign as the accused was taken away.</p>
        
            <p>Mamfredos-Nair was last seen on Birdwood Road in West Auckland's Rānui on 21 April.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Callum McNeill, of Waitematā CIB, called the recovery of the teenager's body "a devastating ordeal for Jayden's whānau, who are still coming to terms with the loss they have suffered".</p>
        
            <p>"We hope that this brings them some closure, in knowing that their boy can now be returned to them so he can be laid to rest."</p>
        
            <p>The trio of men, who have all been granted interim name suppression, were remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>They are expected to appear at the Auckland High Court on 7 February.</p>
