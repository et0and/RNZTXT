            <p>The body of a man who went missing while snorkelling in a Canterbury bay south of Kaikōura has been found.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to Manuka Bay near Domett about 2pm on New Year's Day after the 52-year-old failed to return to shore, incident controller Detective Zeb Harland said.</p>
        
            <p>The local man had been diving with another person in about 5m of water when he went missing.</p>
        
            <p>An aerial search was carried out on Monday while police searched the shore. The police dive squad began a water search on Tuesday morning along with Surf Life Saving crews.</p>
        
            <p>The man's body was found in the water about 3pm on 2 January.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the diver's family, who police are providing with support at this tragic time," Harland said.</p>
        
            <p>"We would like to thank everyone who has assisted with the search."</p>
