            <p>The man accused of murdering a woman in West Auckland last night has appeared in the Waitākere District Court on Monday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to a Brandon Street property just after 11pm on Sunday to find a woman who had been stabbed mutiple times.</p>
        
            <p>She was taken to hospital but died a short time later.</p>
        
            <p>Armed police guarded the scene overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Kim Libby of Waitemata CIB said a 33-year-old man was arrested at the scene and had been charged with her murder.</p>
        
            <p>He was granted interim name suppression and remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>He is expected to appear in the High Court at Auckland later this month.</p>
        
            <p>On a property next to the police cordon, resident Fia, who did not want to give his last name, told RNZ he was sad to hear what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a quiet street, and sadly this happened... our neighbour, it's a bit scary."</p>
        
            <p>Fia said he did not know his neighbours.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't know each other, we don't talk, but their kids always play with our kids."</p>
        
            <p>And further up the road, Jeremy Armstrong said the area was usually safe.</p>
        
            <p>"It's normally a pretty quiet neighbourhood.</p>
        
            <p>"About seven or eight o'clock, everything's real quiet, nothing ever happen."</p>
        
            <p>He said residents would take children and dogs walking on the road.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very shocking," said Armstrong.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not something that normally happens."</p>
        
            <p>Police were not seeking anyone else in relation to the woman's death, Libby said.</p>
        
            <p>Cordons remained in place and a scene examination was underway.</p>
        
            <p>"An increased police presence will remain in the area while enquiries are carried out, however we do not believe there is any ongoing risk to the public.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts are with the victim's family and we are providing them with support at this tragic time."</p>
