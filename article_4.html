            <p>Whangārei District councillors have voted down a motion to abolish their Māori ward in a two-hour, often emotional debate marked by waiata and a celebratory haka from supporters gathered outside.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday morning, Whangārei District Council became the third of Northland's four local authorities to vote on the future of its Māori wards.</p>
        
            <p>A new law that came into effect last month required councils to choose, by 6 September, between abolishing their Māori wards or holding a binding poll alongside next year's local body elections.</p>
        
            <p>Up to 200 people, including many pākehā, gathered outside the council offices on Rust Avenue to show their support for the district's two Māori ward councillors. Only about half could fit inside the chamber, with the rest forced to follow the meeting on screens in the foyer.</p>
        
            <p>Another group remained outside waving flags outside the chamber windows.</p>

            <p>The initial motion, proposed by councillor Paul Yovich and seconded by Marie Olsen, was to disestablish the Whangārei District Māori Ward and revert to the electoral system used in the 2019 election, before the ward was introduced.</p>
        
            <p>That option would have avoided the requirement for a poll or a fresh representation review to adjust ward boundaries or councillor numbers.</p>
        
            <p>It was eventually defeated four votes to nine, sparking cheers inside the chamber and a rousing haka outside.</p>
        
            <p>A follow-up motion, put by councillor Nicholas Connop, called on the council to retain its Māori ward at the 2025 election and hold a referendum to decide the ward's future in the 2028 and 2031 elections. That was carried by 12 votes to one.</p>
        
            <p>At times mayor Vince Cocurullo seemed close to losing his patience with councillors who addressed the public instead of their fellow councillors, and interjections from the public gallery.</p>

            <p>Despite the charged topic - at least two councillors appeared to fight back tears - it remained a respectful meeting in which every speaker was given a fair hearing.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, Northland Regional Council went a step further, with councillors voting 8-1 to retain their two-seat Te Raki Māori ward, and 6-3 to seek advice on the consequences of not holding a poll at the 2025 elections.</p>
        
            <p>During a fiery meeting earlier this month, the Kaipara District Council leapt in the opposite direction, voting 6-3 to disestablish its Te Moananui o Kaipara Māori ward from 2025.</p>
        
            <p>It was the first council in the country to use the new law to abolish a Māori ward.</p>
        
            <p>Kaipara's decision was however being challenged by Ngāti Whatua, which has requested a judicial review.</p>
        
            <p>Far North District councillors have already indicated they intend to retain the four-seat Ngā Tai o Tokerau Māori Ward. They are due to hold a formal vote on 5 September.</p>
