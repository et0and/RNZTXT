            <p>One of the men accused of supplying drugs on social media following police raids in two affluent Wellington suburbs will continue to keep his name secret for now.</p>
        
            <p>The 29-year-old and another man were arrested late last month after a series of police searches in Khandallah and Hataitai that saw cash, cocaine, and cars seized.</p>
        
            <p>He has denied 15 charges including the supply and possession of drugs, and money laundering.</p>
        
            <p>The man elected a trial by jury and was granted interim name suppression earlier in December, which was continued during a bail hearing on Thursday at Wellington District Court.</p>
        
            <p>His lawyer's argument for permanent name suppression will be heard in April, so interim name suppression will continue until then.</p>
        
            <p>The man was granted bail.</p>
        
            <p>His co-accused, a 31-year-old man, is due to appear in court on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the searches came after a two-month investigation into the supply of drugs in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>They claimed the men were selling a significant amount of cocaine via social media and encrypted applications, reaching an "audience of up to 500 people".</p>
        
            <p>During the raids they seized about $50,000 in cash, three vehicles, and 9kg of cannabis with a street value of more than $75,000.</p>

            <p>Khandallah raid] on Lucknow Terrace reported seeing a flurry of police activity for several hours, with plain clothed officers ferrying brown paper bags into unmarked cars.</p>
        
            <p>They said the targeted house was known for its "expensive-looking, big cars" - reportedly a mustang, a ute, and a BMW.</p>
