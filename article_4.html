            <p>The jury has been unable to reach a verdict in a trial of members of climate activist group Restore Passenger Rail.</p>
        
            <p>Four members of the group were charged with endangering transport, related to protests that brought rush-hour traffic to a halt in Wellington, in October 2022.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday the jury found Andrew Sutherland not guilty, but after more than three days of deliberations jurors were unable to reach a verdict for Michael Apathy, Thomas Taptiklis and Te Wehi Ratana.</p>
        
            <p>The jurors have been discharged and a retrial ordered.</p>
        
            <p>The remaining defendants have been granted bail.</p>
        
            <p>All four defendants faced charges of endangering transport - which carries a maximum 14-year jail term - related to three protests in October 2022 that called for passenger rail services to be restored.</p>
        
            <p>Protest banners were strung above rush-hour traffic on Wellington's State Highway 1 at the mouth of the Mt Victoria Tunnel on 18 October, and from gantries above the motorway at Bolton Street on 10 October and Johnsonville on 27 October.</p>
        
            <p>Apathy, Ratana, and Sutherland pleaded not guilty to one charge, while Taptiklis pleaded not guilty to two charges.</p>
        
            <p>Police told the jury the danger posed by the protesters forced them to stop traffic.</p>
        
            <p>The jury also heard uncontested evidence from two climate scientists, who outlined the emissions-driven climate crisis and the fossil fuel industry's decades-long misinformation campaign denying it.</p>
        
            <p>In his summary of the case Judge Stephen Harrop instructed jurors to put aside their sympathies and weigh whether the climate change protests were reasonable.</p>
        
            <p>He said while New Zealand protected the right to free speech, that did not grant protesters immunity from prosecution.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown submitted that there was no social utility in the protesters' actions and no reasonable person would "dangle themselves deliberately, like a circus act" above rush-hour traffic.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutors said the protests were objectively reckless and therefore criminal.</p>
        
            <p>The defence said the existential threat of the climate crisis meant that their actions were entirely justified - they were not protesting the size of coffee servings.</p>
        
            <p>The defence counsel maintained that any danger posed by the protesters' actions was far outweighed by the social utility of drawing people's attention to the political inaction on climate change.</p>
        
            <p>The trial began on 26 February and jurors retired on 6 March to consider their verdicts.</p>
        
            <p>During deliberations the jury sought direction from the judge on two matters and asked to re-watch social media footage of one of the protests.</p>
        
            <p>Before discharging the jury, the judge thanked jurors for their time and effort, acknowledging the difficulty of the task they were given.</p>
