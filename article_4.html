            <p>Masterton was the hottest in the land but scorching temperatures were felt throughout the country on Sunday with most of the country in the high 20s.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said that Masterton was top with a high of 33C, but that was still 2 degrees short of the record January temperature of 35C in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Multiple other locations were close behind, with Auckland, Palmerston North, Hastings and Kawerau all hitting 30C temperatures or just above.</p>
        
            <p>Just below at 29C highs were Hamilton, Kaitaia, Gisborne, Napier, Wellington and Blenheim.</p>
        
            <p>If you were looking for a spot to cool off, the lowest high of the day was in Haast at 21C, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>Masterton took the high today with 33 degrees still 2 degrees shy of their 35 Jan high back in 2021. Cooler in Haast with 21 degrees. pic.twitter.com/YBuuqz15oS</p>
        
            <p>But the heat on Sunday was mixed with scattered showers in many places, forecasters said.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain warning is in place for Tai RƒÅwhiti north of Tolaga Bay for Sunday and into Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Duty meteorologist Surprise Mhlongo said the area could see up to 175 millimetres of rain between 6pm Sunday and midday Monday.</p>
