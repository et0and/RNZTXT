            <p>Police are treating a fire that burned through 5ha of bush on the Kāpiti Coast as suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters were alerted to the blaze, inland from Ōtaki Beach, just after 5pm on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>It burnt through heavy scrub and could be seen from as far away as Paraparaumu - a distance of 14km.</p>
        
            <p>Police said firefighters found two teenagers trapped in the bush.</p>
        
            <p>They were able to assist the boys to safety "through difficult terrain".</p>
        
            <p>The teens, both 17, were now assisting criminal inquiries and would be referred to Youth Services, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said the fire had been contained on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>The top priority had been keeping it away from houses and this had been successful.</p>
        
            <p>Three rural fire crews had been monitoring hot spots overnight, along with a FENZ Drone Team.</p>
        
            <p>Crews were due back on the fire ground on Sunday to put the fire out completely.</p>
