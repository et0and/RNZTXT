            <p>A funeral for the New Zealander killed during a robbery in the United States will be held next week in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Trish McKay was pulled onto the road after a struggle during an attempted robbery at a California mall on 2 July. She was killed after being hit by a car driven by one of the offenders.</p>
        
            <p>An obituary posted online said a celebration of McKay's life would be held at St Patrick's Cathedral on Friday, 19 July, followed by a wake at Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>It described the 68-year-old as a beloved wife, devoted mother and cherished grandmother. McKay was married to businessman Doug McKay, a former chair of BNZ's board. He was reported by US media as being with her when the attack happened.</p>
        
            <p>"She also had a special bond with her daughters-in-law... and was dearly loved by her Jack Russell, Archie," the obituary said.</p>

            <p>"Patricia was known for her welcoming and kind nature, and her affectionate laugh. She touched many lives with her warmth, generosity, and appreciative spirit."</p>
        
            <p>A tribute written by someone who knew McKay described her as "a beautiful soul", and said she was "one of the most treasured in our family".</p>
        
            <p>She would be deeply missed by those who knew her, the obituary said.</p>
        
            <p>Jaden Cunningham and Malachi Darnell, both 18, and Leroy McCrary, 26, have been charged with her murder.</p>
