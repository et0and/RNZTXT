            <p>A man is in a serious condition after a fire in his prison cell at Spring Hill Corrections Facility in the Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>The corrections facility's acting general manager Alan Lamb said the fire happened at 4.45pm on Friday, but for "security reasons", he could not say how it started.</p>
        
            <p>The prison's sprinkler system activated and extinguished the fire, Lamb said, and staff responded immediately to remove the man from his cell.</p>
        
            <p>"There was no threat to the wider security of the prison," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Due to smoke inhalation an ambulance was called for the man, Lamb confirmed, and he was taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>No other staff or prisoners were impacted, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The prisoner who started the fire will face internal misconduct charges."</p>
        
            <p>St John confirmed it responded to the area on Friday afternoon and took a person with serious injuries to Waikato Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency northern shift manager Hayley Prince said they sent three fire trucks to the facility at 5:12pm.</p>
