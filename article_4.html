        <h2>RSV immunisation for babies: Doctors call for urgent access</h2>
        <p>
Doctors are calling for urgent access to a new immunisation to protect babies from the dangerous RSV virus.

            <p>
The immunisation is not a vaccine, but a monoclonal antibody, providing protection for a few months.

            <p>Doctors are calling for urgent access to a new immunisation to protect babies from the dangerous RSV virus.</p>
        
            <p>Three states in Australia have just agreed to fund nirsevimab to protect babies against the respiratory virus that has hospitalised hundreds in New Zealand in recent winters.</p>
        
            <p>The disease could leave seriously affected infants struggling to breathe, eat and drink, with many needing oxygen and some ending up on ventilators.</p>
        
            <p>Infectious diseases paediatrician Emma Best was leading the call to give at-risk New Zealand under-one-year-olds access to the medicine.</p>
        
            <p>"That's those babies born premature and with other medical conditions where RSV becomes more than just a respiratory illness but something that leads them to needing intensive care," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The immunisation was not a vaccine, but a monoclonal antibody.</p>
        
            <p>It was given as an injection and protected for only a few months but could get vulnerable babies safely through their first winter, Dr Best said.</p>
        
            <p>Without it, the virus was likely to remain the highest reason for babies to be hospitalised each winter.</p>
        
            <p>The disease was very distressing, including for parents, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Babies were often so busy trying to breathe, they could not eat or drink, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't have any medicines to make them better from the virus. We just support them with oxygen, sometimes even ventilation in intensive care," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Trials overseas showed the nirsevimab could cut hospitalisation rates by 80 percent.</p>
        
            <p>There was a sticking point to getting it funded this year - it was not yet approved for use in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>It was given the go ahead by the United States, Europe and Australia last year, with Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales funding it this winter to various degrees.</p>
        
            <p>Pharmaceutical company Sanofi manufactured the immunisation under the brand name Beyfortus.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said it had started a conversation with Pharmac but was not able to speculate on its future availability.</p>
        
            <p>Pharmac has been approached for comment.</p>
