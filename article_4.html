            <p>Northland crews have been working to contain three scrub fires across the region.</p>
        
            <p>A blaze west of Dargaville broke out on Friday and has burned through 15 hectares.</p>
        
            <p>Fire-fighters are extending the fire break line to prevent it spreading.</p>
        
            <p>Further north, three fire trucks, a water tanker and a helicopter are being used to contain a scrub fire at Ahipara.</p>
        
            <p>The one-hectare blaze is on the side of a hill at the Kaitaia-Awaroa Road.</p>
        
            <p>East of Kaitaia, at Hihi, fire crews have also extinguished a vegetation blaze.</p>
