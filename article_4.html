            <p>A woman has been arrested for allegedly suppressing evidence in connection to the murder of Christchurch man David Bridgwater.</p>
        
            <p>Bridgwater, 38, was found dead on Carisbrooke Street in the eastern suburb of Aranui in the early hours of 4 January, sparking a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>A 51-year-old woman was charged with accessory after the fact of his murder on Wednesday and appeared in Christchurch District Court on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>According to court documents, she was charged with "actively suppressing evidence by preventing access to CCTV data".</p>
        
            <p>Judge Katie Elkin granted the woman name suppression and remanded her in custody until her next court appearance in February.</p>
        
            <p>Police earlier said they had received more than 20 pieces of information from the public in relation to the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>But they were continuing their inquiries and asked anyone with information that could help to call 105 or report in on the police website.</p>
        
            <p>People were asked to reference "Operation Walter".</p>
