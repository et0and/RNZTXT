            <p>A motorcyclist has died after a crash in the Whakatāne district.</p>
        
            <p>The crash in Murupara just before 1pm Saturday afternoon left the Main Road closed between Pine Drive and Kowhai Avenue for several hours. It has since reopened.</p>
        
            <p>"Efforts to resuscitate the person were unsuccessful and they died at the scene," police said.</p>
        
            <p>One other person has suffered serious injuries in the crash and they have been hospitalised. It was unclear which person was the driver.</p>
        
            <p>The holiday road fatality toll which runs until 6 January is believed to now be six.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, another crash in the Auckland suburb of Pakuranga Saturday morning left a motorcyclist critically injured.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the intersection of Pakuranga Road and Stanniland Street shortly after 8:50am on Saturday.</p>
