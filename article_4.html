            <p>Te Whatu Ora has confirmed one case and identified a second probable case, both involving young children.</p>
        
            <p>The children had spent time in Auckland, Waikato and Tauranga visiting family members between 23 and 26 March.</p>
        
            <p>There's no link to travel abroad and it is believed the children caught the highly contagious disease locally, National Public Health Service clinical director Dr William Rainger said.</p>
        
            <p>He said being vaccinated against measles is crucial, and anyone with symptoms should stay home and seek advice before visiting a doctor.</p>
        
            <p>Symptoms of measles can start about a week to 18 days after a person has been exposed to the virus, Te Whatu Ora advised on its website.</p>
        
            <p>A fever, cough, runny nose, and sore red eyes are among the most common symptoms.</p>
        
            <p>It can be followed by a red or dark pink rash on the face or behind the ears about three days after the first symptoms. White spots can also appear in the mouth.</p>
        
            <p>The spots, while not itchy, can be blotchy and close to one another. This can last for more than a week.</p>
        
            <p>It can leave children in bed for about five days but still unable to attend school for a couple of weeks.</p>
