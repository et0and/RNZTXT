            <p>ACC says it has taken a range of precautions before testing AI inside its systems.</p>
        
            <p>The Accident Compensation Corporation has had 300 users testing Microsoft's Copilot AI since January.</p>
        
            <p>It is being used in the back office to draft content, summarise meetings and research information and files.</p>
        
            <p>ACC said it had done a privacy risk assessment, a privacy impact assessment, an ethics review, and security assessment and testing on the AI.</p>
        
            <p>Users were trained and had to check whatever AI came up with.</p>
        
            <p>The users "are exploring possible additional uses for this technology", it told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>In June, ACC confirmed it was axing 300 jobs as part of government-ordered cost-savings, which unions warned would lead to less reliable services.</p>
        
            <p>"In the time ACC has been using Copilot some of the benefits include reduced time and effort writing meeting notes, easier/quicker access to, and summarisation of, information, and [it] has reduced reporting and data processing times," said acting deputy chief executive of enterprise change, Campbell Mackie.</p>
        
            <p>"Copilot abides by existing access and permission controls, drawing information only from sources the user has permissions to access."</p>
