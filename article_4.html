        <h2>NASA's Hubble telescope captures Matariki</h2>
        <p>
Hubble has been in continuous orbit around the Earth for 34 years and it measured the cluster at about 440 light years away from us. Audio

            <p>NASA's Hubble space telescope has provided the best images of the Matariki star cluster.</p>
        
            <p>Hubble has been in continuous orbit around the Earth for 34 years and it measured the cluster at about 440 light years away from us.</p>
        
            <p>NASA senior project scientist for Hubble Dr Jennifer Wiseman said the cluster, also known as the Pleiades, was relatively close in astronomical terms.</p>
        
            <p>"I would say what Hubble has given us in looking at the Pleiades is a more accurate distance, something like 439 light years and also a very beautiful sharp image."</p>
        
            <p>The telescope has made more than a million observations which have expanded our understanding of the universe.</p>
        
            <p>The 'Man behind Matariki' said he was excited to see the idea of a Matariki public holiday spread across the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>Dr Rangi Mātāmua was invited to Tahiti recently to see how Aotearoa put together the Matariki holiday.</p>
        
            <p>The territory just announced their inaugural Matari'i public holiday - which will be observed on the 20 November next year.</p>
