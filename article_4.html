            <p>Two teenagers have been charged after a stolen car was spotted speeding, hit another car on a motorway and was abandoned in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Around 5.40pm on Sunday, police were told about a stolen vehicle speeding on Mortimer Pass in Newmarket.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City Central Area Commander, Inspector Grant Tetzlaff, said police attempted to stop the vehicle, however it failed to do so and a pursuit was not initiated.</p>
        
            <p>The Police Eagle helicopter tracked the vehicle as it entered the Northwestern Motorway at Lincoln Road and travelled west before hitting another car.</p>
        
            <p>It continued travelling on the wrong side of the road before one of the tyres blew out, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle was then abandoned on Rata Road in Whenuapai, where two teenagers were taken into custody.</p>
        
            <p>"It is incredibly lucky no one was injured," Inspector Tetzlaff says.</p>
        
            <p>"This is another example of great work by Police staff from across different areas, all working together to hold offenders to account."</p>
        
            <p>A 19-year-old man will appear in Auckland District Court today charged with failing to stop, unlawfully taking a motor vehicle and reckless driving.</p>
        
            <p>A 14-year-old was referred to Youth Aid Services.</p>
