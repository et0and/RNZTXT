            <p>Hundreds of people gathered at Christchurch's Bridge of Remembrance on Tuesday evening as part of a national protest against the new government's policies on co-governance and the Treaty.</p>
        
            <p>Many carried tino rangatiratanga flags and signs with slogans like "Ka whawhai tonu mātou - we will fight on".</p>
        
            <p>The crowd was led by the organisers in a series of waiata while they wait for the opening karakia to begin, and the sound of conch shells are ringing out as the protesters prepared to hikoi.</p>
        
            <p>The group then walked along the Ōtākaro Avon River towards Victoria Square, causing traffic to back up.</p>

Andrina Taukiri said she was at the demonstration for her culture and for her mokopuna.
