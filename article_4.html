            <p>Staff at a Tokoroa rest home who failed to provide adequate respite care for an elderly man who died have been ordered to apologise to his family.</p>
        
            <p>The man in his 80s had Parkinson's disease, heart failure and recurring strokes when he had an unwitnessed fall on his first day of a five-day stay at Victoria Place Rest Home, owned by Oceania Care Company.</p>
        
            <p>Aged care commissioner Carolyn Cooper said Oceania Care Company breached the man's rights by not undertaking a risk assessment or responding properly to his fall.</p>
        
            <p>On his first night at the rest home, the man had an unwitnessed fall and his condition began to deteriorate from there, Cooper said.</p>
        
            <p>On the third day of his stay, the man's whānau insisted an ambulance be called and he was admitted to hospital where scans indicated he had suffered strokes.</p>
        
            <p>The man's health continued to decline and he died two weeks later.</p>
        
            <p>Cooper found after the man's fall, no post-fall assessment was done and he was not observed for any neurological issues.</p>
        
            <p>The man was short of breath, Cooper said, but there was "minimal" follow-up monitoring of this by staff.</p>
        
            <p>A "lack of respect" was shown to the man and his whānau, Cooper noted.</p>
        
            <p>This included staff being dismissive of injuries post-fall, disregarding a letter from the man's GP that was shown to staff by his wife, and only calling an ambulance when his daughter-in-law threatened to drive him to hospital herself.</p>
        
            <p>"Although some of these incidents are disputed, and, if they occurred, could be seen to be the actions of individual staff, my view is that management should set a positive culture with residents' wellbeing at the centre, and Oceania failed to do so," Cooper said.</p>
        
            <p>A nurse at the home also breached the code for failing to provide services with reasonable care and skill.</p>
        
            <p>Cooper said the nurse needed to "take responsibility for her failures" and the failures of several of her staff to provide appropriate care to the man.</p>
        
            <p>Several recommendations were made for Oceania Care by Cooper which included apologising to the man's family.</p>
        
            <p>Cooper noted Oceania Care had made several changes since the complaint.</p>
