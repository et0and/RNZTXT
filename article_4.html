        <h2>Man photographed with banned cat in national park</h2>
        <p>
DOC is hoping to avoid a cat-astrophe after a man was seen feeding a cat in a national park home to threatened species, including kiwi.

            <p>The Department of Conservation (DOC) is on the hunt for a man who appears to have taken a cat into a national park, where they are banned.</p>
        
            <p>The incursion followed a plea not to take pets into Egmont National Park/Te Papa-Kura-o-Taranaki as they are a threat to wildlife.</p>
        
            <p>DOC in August 2022 asked the public to leave their animals at home after several incidents of jacket-clad cats, tropical birds and dogs being brought into the park.</p>
        
            <p>There was a "flurry of media and online interest" at the time, DOC senior ranger Cameron Hunt said, but people were still doing it.</p>
        
            <p>"We've been alerted to another case of a pet cat in the park with its owner - and just like last year, we have the picture to prove it."</p>
        
            <p>The latest case happened in October on the Pouakai Track. The photo shows a man sitting with a cat on his lap, the feline tucking into a bowl of food. Another person in the photo appears to be taking a photo of the pair.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty clear what's shown in the photograph is occurring inside the boundaries of the national park," Hunt said.</p>
        
            <p>"This man's face is shown in the photograph - someone must know who he is.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't know if that's his cat, but regardless the animal appears to be in his care and he should not have it within the national park."</p>
        
            <p>Te Papa-Kura-o-Taranaki is home to threatened and protected species, including kiwi and whio, DOC said.</p>
        
            <p>If he is the owner of the cat, the mystery man faced a fine of up to $800, DOC said, or up to $100,000 - or a year in prison - if he was a repeat offender.</p>
        
            <p>The pet faced being seized and impounded.</p>
        
            <p>DOC said anyone who can identify the man should call 0272461083 or email Hunt on chunt@doc.govt.nz.</p>
