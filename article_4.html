            <p>Twelve fire trucks and 35 firefighters had been working to extinguish the blaze at Frankton Motor on Ellis Street since about 11:30am.</p>

            <p>Walklin said a fire investigator was at the scene to determine the cause of the fire.</p>
        
            <p>He said a gas representative from Auckland Council also visited the site to make sure it was safe for workers at nearby businesses to return.</p>
        
            <p>During the blaze, the street was closed and people in neighbouring areas had been evacuated.</p>

            <p>A Frankton business owner said its staff were evacuated after the fire broke out.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a Hamilton City Council spokesperson said the Animal Education and Control centre, nearby to the fire, has been closed for the day, but there was no threat to the building and no staff or animals were evacuated.</p>
        
            <p>Jamin from iPlumber said their receptionist called FENZ about 11:30am after noticing Frankton Motor across the road on Ellis Street was on fire.</p>
        
            <p>"She called the fire trucks and they took about 10 minutes to get there. We just saw the smoke and it went up pretty quick. The sign burnt out the front and flames started coming up through the roof in about five or 10 minutes and the smoke got a lot thicker.</p>

            <p>"Surrounding businesses came out onto the street wondering, 'What the hell is going on here?' That's not good for a Monday".</p>
        
            <p>He said FENZ and police made sure everyone in the area got out.</p>
