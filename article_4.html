            <p>A chilly polar blast is set to hit the country after an unusually warm week.</p>
        
            <p>Cold southerlies could bring snow to low levels - 400-500m - in the South Island on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService forecaster John Law told Morning Report temperatures would return to normal winter levels.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not out of winter just yet, we may be lulled into a false sense of security with some of those high temperatures we'll see over the next couple of days."</p>
        
            <p>Anyone planning to travel around the mountain passes in the South Island next week should watch the forecast, Law said.</p>
        
            <p>By the middle of next week there may be some snow in the central North Island as well, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Definitely the time of the year to take extra care and extra time on the roads."</p>
