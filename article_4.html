        <h2>Govt keeping eye on calls for Sikh activists 'referendum' in Auckland</h2>
        <p>
The issue assumes significance with potential repercussions for New Zealand-India relations, which have seen a major up-tick in recent months.
</p>
        
            <p>An initiative by US-based Sikh activists, advocating for the creation of an independent homeland for Sikhs within India, to hold a "referendum" in Auckland on the issue is being closely monitored by the government.</p>
        
            <p>President of the organisation Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), Avtar Singh Pannun, who is now in New Zealand, has been mobilising support for the non-official, non-binding "referendum" visiting Gurudwaras [Sikh temples] in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>He also led a car rally in Auckland on 19 October which went from Takanini to the Indian Consulate's temporary premises in Eden Terrace, during which protesters allegedly engaged in hate speeches and desecrated the Indian national flag.</p>
        
            <p>SFJ, which was formed in 2007 in the US by Pannu and his brother Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, has organised "referendums" in a few cities in some countries including Australia, the UK and Canada. It has now proposed to hold one such in Auckland on 17 November.</p>
        
            <p>India refers to Gurpatwant as a terrorist and has banned SFJ under its terrorism laws.</p>
        
            <p>That's why the issue assumes significance with potential repercussions for New Zealand-India relations, which have seen a major up-tick in recent months, prompting the government to respond.</p>
        
            <p>"We are aware of the so-called 'referendum' by a non-government organisation. New Zealand is a strong supporter of human rights, at home and around the world, including freedom of speech provided such initiatives are lawful and peaceful," A Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) spokesperson said on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>When asked about the government's view on the demand for a separate state included in the "referendum", the MFAT spokesperson said: "New Zealand recognises India's sovereignty and territorial integrity".</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand Indian Central Association (NZICA) - one of the oldest Indian associations in New Zealand established in 1926 - approached the Police Minister Mark Mitchell expressing concerns at what it called "police inaction while Khalistani car rally protesters engaged in illegal parking, hate speeches and desecration of the Indian flag".</p>
        
            <p>President of the Association - located at the premises in Eden Terrace where the protest happened - Narendra Bhana said: "[This] act of desecration is not only an insult to a national symbol but also deeply offensive to the Indian community in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>Bhana told RNZ on Friday that police has since clarified to him it doesn't have the power to stop protesters burning or disrespecting flags.</p>
        
            <p>"They [police] are unable to intervene until protesters start damaging property or causing harm. I have been assured the Police Minister will arrange a meeting next week to address this issue," he added.</p>
        
            <p>Police Minister Mark Mitchell while confirming the letter from NZICA refused to comment further.</p>
        
            <p>"I can confirm my office received a letter from the NZICA on 24 October. A response is currently being drafted, and they can expect to receive it shortly. Police have full operational independence, and it would be inappropriate for me to provide comment on their operational decisions," Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>Experts have weighed in as well on what the proposed referendum means for New Zealand -India relations, considering the ongoing diplomatic stand-off between India and Canada over the issue.</p>
        
            <p>Relations between the two countries are at a new low with expulsion of top diplomats and escalating tensions over the assassination of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada.</p>
        
            <p>Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies at the Victoria University in Wellington, David Capie, argued India must be keeping a close eye on developments in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sure the referendum will be watched very closely in Delhi. If we saw unrest or any sign that pro-Khalistan groups had any sort of official blessing, then Indian officials would doubtless raise the issue with New Zealand counterparts. But I don't think either side wants this to become a big issue in the relationship right now," Capie said.</p>

            <p>Former National MP Kanwaljit Singh Bakshi (2008-20), who has the distinction of being New Zealand's first India-born lawmaker, was much more vocal noting "the proposed referendum on Khalistan will likely hurt New Zealand-India relations, particularly given India's apparent position on the issue of its territorial integrity".</p>
        
            <p>"It's essential to recognise this referendum does not represent the views of most Sikhs in New Zealand. Influenced by external forces ... a small section is pushing this agenda. New Zealand mustn't let this affect its diplomatic relationship with India," Bakshi said.</p>
        
            <p>"For most Sikhs in New Zealand, the Khalistan issue holds minor to no significance. The Sikh community here primarily focuses on building successful lives in New Zealand while maintaining cultural and religious ties with India."</p>
        
            <p>"Per my understanding, the referendum has minimal support from the Sikh community in New Zealand, especially in Auckland. The push for this referendum is primarily driven by a tiny and vocal minority, some of whom may have been influenced by forces outside New Zealand and India," added Bakshi. "The wider New Zealand public has little interest or involvement in this issue, and it should be understood in that context."</p>
        
            <p>Another community organisation, Country Section New Zealand Indian Association (CSNZIA), also shared similar views.</p>
        
            <p>"Our association was established in 1926 and represent all Indians living in New Zealand. As per NZICA president [Narendra Bhana], we do not support people who disrespect Indian national flag. We don't support any extremism or discrimination especially if it is against India," said former president of CSNZIA, Rupinder Virk.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ made multiple attempts to contact Sikhs for Justice and its president Avtar Singh Pannun, but all calls, messages and emails went unanswered.</p>
        
            <p>The Indian High Commission didn't respond to requests for comment on the matter.</p>
