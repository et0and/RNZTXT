            <p>Limits have been set for the maximum size of vessels able to use Tory Channel in the Marlborough Sounds - to give operators clarity when investing in new vessels.</p>
        
            <p>Marlborough harbourmaster Jake Oliver has issued a direction setting a maximum length of 187 metres for any new vessels looking to use the Tory Channel to access Marlborough ports at Picton and Shakespeare Bay.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after a navigation safety risk assessment was done - looking at past vessel crossings, vessel risk management documents and relevant Transport Accident Investigation Commission reports.</p>
        
            <p>Oliver said the entrance to the Tory Channel was narrow and tidal, which made it challenging to navigate, with the risk of an incident increasing with longer vessels.</p>
        
            <p>"We know from our review that vessels at and under 187 metres can travel through the channel safely. The only time these vessels wouldn't use the channel is if they have an issue while crossing the Cook Strait, such as a malfunction of navigation equipment, steering system or propulsion engines - anything that could mean their journey through the channel is dangerous - making the Northern Entrance route the safer option."</p>
        
            <p>Oliver said the direction would not affect the current Cook Strait ferries - which were all less than 187 metres in length.</p>
        
            <p>"This direction is about preparing for the future, for when companies look to invest in new vessels," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It means that companies with vessels over this length will use the Northern Entrance to dock at Picton or Shakespeare Bay, just like some heavy vessels are required to now, or work with us on safety management plans for using Tory Channel."</p>
        
            <p>It also does not apply to cruise ships - which have not been allowed to use the Tory Channel since the Azamara Quest incident in 2016, when the ship grounded on Wheki Rock inside the entrance.</p>
