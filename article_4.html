            <p>Police have arrested another funeral director in relation to an investigation relating to inappropriate handling of burials at an Auckland cemetery.</p>
        
            <p>The man is the second person to be arrested as police investigate complaints about bodies being "inappropriately handled" prior to burial, evidence of which came to light after they were disinterred following flooding at the Waikumete Cemetery in early 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Police have also been investigating fraud allegations.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland man arrested on Friday has been charged with obtaining money by deception.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin said the investigation was ongoing and police could not rule out further charges being laid.</p>
        
            <p>"Our investigation team has been looking at allegations that loved ones' remains were inappropriately handled at the cemetery's mausoleum."</p>
        
            <p>Investigators had been working through complex issues and were still keen to hear from other families that may have been impacted or had concerns, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Fiona Bakulich, a former employee of Tipene Funerals, pleaded guilty to interfering with human remains and 12 counts of obtaining by deception.</p>
        
            <p>The charges also related to bodies disinterred at Waikumete Cemetery during flooding in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>She will be sentenced in April.</p>
        
            <p>The Auckland man arrested on Friday is expected to appear in Auckland District Court on 20 March.</p>
        
            <p>Correction: This story was amended on Saturday morning to include that Bakulich had pleaded guilty to the charges in February. It also now correctly notes the evidence of interference came to light after the bodies were disinterred, leading to complaints - not that the complaints were about the bodies being disinterred. RNZ apologises for the confusion.</p>
