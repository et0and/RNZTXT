            <p>The pathologist who determined Gore child Lachlan Jones died from drowning says he saw no signs that the boy had been put in a freezer.</p>
        
            <p>The three-year-old was found face-up in a council sewage pond just over a kilometre from his mother's home in January 2019.</p>
        
            <p>Two police investigations found Lachlan accidentally drowned, but his father, Paul Jones, disagreed.</p>
        
            <p>Lachlan's half-brother has been accused of putting his body in a freezer hours before he was found at the sewage oxidation pond.</p>
        
            <p>The pathologist, who has name suppression, told the inquest that it would have been easy to identify if he had been put in a freezer and Lachlan's body showed no signs of that.</p>
        
            <p>He said he found nothing suspicious or surprising during his autopsy, including no external trauma, and he stood by his conclusion.</p>
        
            <p>He would have asked for a more thorough forensic autopsy if he found anything surprising, and did not agree with two forensic pathologists who said that drowning could not safely be concluded.</p>
        
            <p>But the pathologist said he was unaware there were concerns about Lachlan's death, or that a more thorough forensic autopsy had initially been requested, but then withdrawn.</p>
        
            <p>A forensic pathologist should have performed the autopsy, as Southland was not set up to autopsy children, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The form he received before the autopsy noted the death was not suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>He noted a family member had opposed the autopsy, and thought it might get cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>He told his lawyer Adam Holloway he chose to proceed with the autopsy once he was told to avoid the delay for Lachlan's mother.</p>
