            <p>Police have charged a man with murder after a woman's body was discovered in a burnt-out car.</p>
        
            <p>Jasmaine Corin Reihana, 35, was found dead inside the car on 9 September on Ripiro Beach, Dargaville.</p>
        
            <p>Her body was found by firefighters responding to reports of a car fire on the beach, a few kilometres south of Glink's Gully.</p>
        
            <p>They alerted police, who launched a homicide inquiry and carried out detailed scene investigations at the beach and a home in the nearby town to Te Kopuru.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they charged a 34-year-old man with murder on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have conducted an extensive investigation to ensure the person responsible for her murder can be held to account," detective inspector Al Symonds said.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to acknowledge the investigation team, who have worked tirelessly to get this result, and also those members of our community who have assisted our enquiries.</p>
        
            <p>"Thank you to everyone who has come forward with information during the course of this investigation."</p>
        
            <p>Symonds said police were not looking for anyone else in relation to the Paihia woman's death.</p>
        
            <p>"It has been our team's focus to hold to account the person we will allege is responsible for Jasmine's murder, and we hope this brings some relief to her whānau."</p>
        
            <p>The murder-accused would appear in Whangārei District Court on Monday, Symonds said.</p>
