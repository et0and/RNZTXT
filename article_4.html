            <p>A French-operated flight will bring stranded New Zealanders to Brisbane, with a New Zealand Defence Force flight arranged for the travel from Brisbane to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The French flight is due to depart Tontouta Airport at 6pm NZ time with 49 Kiwis on board.</p>
        
            <p>The flight from Brisbane to Auckland is due to arrive at Auckland International Airport at 1am NZ time.</p>
        
            <p>MFAT said it was still working with French and Australian authorities on logistics.</p>
        
            <p>Around 10pm last night a Defence Force flight completed the first mercy mission, landing in Auckland with 48 New Zealanders on board.</p>
        
            <p>MFAT said 260 New Zealanders remain and are hoping to leave Noumea (of the 274 NZers in New Caledonia registered on Safetravel).</p>
        
            <p>It is believed that in total there would have been at least 371 NZers in New Caledonia when the conflict erupted.</p>
        
            <p>It has claimed six lives while millions of dollars in damages has been caused to businesses and infrastructure.</p>
