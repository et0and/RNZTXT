            <p>A sculpture made from pieces of the cyclone and flood-wrecked homes in Muriwai on Auckland's west coast has been unveiled.</p>
        
            <p>Seven unique columns designed by sculptor Jeff Thomson, whose work included the Taihape Boot and the Auckland Zoo Elephant, could be viewed in Muriwai's town centre from Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Long-time Muriwai resident and organiser Abe Dew said hundreds of local volunteers and several local artists helped with the project over the past two years; creating mosaics and trawling for materials.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a quilt of materials that have been salvaged from houses that have been demolished."</p>
        
            <p>"Galvanised iron, tap fittings, sinks, tiles, bits of corrugated roofing, and letter boxes, have all been formed into colourful mosaic blocks.</p>
        
            <p>"Jeff Thomson has been incredibly generous and it's wonderful for an artist of his stature to have created something so meaningful for our little village."</p>
        
            <p>In Muriwai, 68 properties including Dew's were deemed unliveable after Cyclone Gabrielle and flooding in 2023. Two volunteer firefighters - Craig Stevens and Dave van Zwanenberg - were also killed by a slip.</p>
        
            <p>Dew said the artwork was a permanent acknowledgement of the devastation the storms caused.</p>
        
            <p>He said it had been emotional for people to recognise parts of their former homes in the sculpture.</p>
        
            <p>"We've heard stories of people welling up when they see it because it means an awful lot to this community.</p>
        
            <p>"It talks about climate change and what happens to people when big events like this happen."</p>

            <p>The sculpture also included messages from people who lost their homes and had to move away from the community.</p>
        
            <p>Muriwai resident Joss Hong from the Muriwai Artists Collective said the process of working on the sculpture had been rehabilitative for many in the community.</p>
        
            <p>Hong ran free mosaic making workshops at the Muriwai Surf Club, where storm-affected residents took shelter back in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"Being together at the surf club was quite a cathartic experience.</p>
        
            <p>"The conversations at those workshops were at times really emotional and helped people through the grieving process.</p>
        
            <p>"It's [the sculpture] really is a reflection of Muriwai's spirit and resilience."</p>
        
            <p>Hong hoped the sculpture would also be a celebration of the happy memories of the community that once was.</p>
