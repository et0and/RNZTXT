            <p>One person has died following a crash on the Lindis Pass north of Cromwell in Otago this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the crash took place about 15 kilometres from the summit of the pass on State Highway 8 at about 8:30am.</p>
        
            <p>The crash involved a car and a motorcyclist.</p>
        
            <p>The motorcyclist died at the scene, while the driver of the car received moderate injuries and was taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The road remains closed while emergency services are at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The pass on State Highway 8 is the main inland route between Canterbury and Otago.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi said southbound traffic could detour via SH83, SH1, SH85 and back onto SH8, with the reverse available for northbound traffic - with advice to allow up to an additional 2.5 hours for this route.</p>
