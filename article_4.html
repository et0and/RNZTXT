            <p>Four people have been arrested in Waihi in relation to a spate of burglaries in the area, including two who were arrested as they walked past the police station.</p>
        
            <p>Waihi sergeant Nigel Sanderson said clothing, food and a car were allegedly stolen from holiday parks and a home across a fortnight earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>He said information from the public helped officers identify the suspects.</p>
        
            <p>"The information they provided us allowed us to act quickly - and two of the accused were arrested as they walked past the Waihi Police station."</p>
        
            <p>A 31-year-old woman and 40-year-old man, both of Karangahake, have been jointly charged with burglary from a holiday park; a 48-year-old Auckland man was also charged with burglary from a separate holiday park; while a 24-year-old Waihi man has been charged with burglary of a residential property.</p>
        
            <p>All four were facing burglary charges in court at later dates.</p>
        
            <p>"It's horrible knowing that someone has invaded your home or rifled through your property, and it's great being able to get this result for the victims," Sanderson said.</p>
