            <p>Steam, gas and ash has been observed at Whakaari / White Island, GeoNet says.</p>
        
            <p>Over the past week, GeoNet has observed "large, white, steam-rich plumes" from its webcams at Whakatāne and Te Kaha.</p>
        
            <p>"During the weekend, small amounts of volcanic ash were observed in the plume on satellite imagery by our colleagues at MetService which could also be seen as a faint haze from the coast," the agency said.</p>
        
            <p>"On several days last week, sulphur dioxide (SO₂) emissions were detected by satellite which may have been noticed by residents on the coast as sulphur odours during northerly wind conditions."</p>
        
            <p>Duty volcanologist Yannic Behr said volcanic ash in the plume could be seen as a faint haze from the coast.</p>
        
            <p>"Over the past week, large white, steam-rich plumes could be seen from our webcams at Whakatāne and Te Kaha," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Since the weekend, small amounts of volcanic ash have been observed in the plume on satellite imagery by our colleagues at MetService which could also be seen as a faint haze from the coast."</p>
        
            <p>Behr said last week, sulphur dioxide emissions were detected by satellite and residents on the coast may have noticed a smell of sulphur.</p>
        
            <p>He said the volcanic activity was consistent with the current alert level and it was the presence of ash which had changed the aviation code, which ranges from green to red.</p>
        
            <p>"Without sensors on the island, our monitoring continues to rely on remote cameras, satellite imagery, and periodic observation and gas flights to monitor Whakaari," Behr said.</p>
        
            <p>GeoNet has raised the aviation colour code to orange, meanwhile, the volcanic alert level remains at 2.</p>
        
            <p>It said steam, gas and ash emissions remain variable over the past few months, which is consistent with moderate-heightened unrest and, therefore, the alert level has remained at level 2.</p>
        
            <p>GNS Science's Volcano Monitoring Group and National Geohazards Monitoring Centre will continue to closely monitor Whakaari/White Island for any changes in activity.</p>
