            <p>The fall-out over Health New Zealand's budget continues with the Prime Minister saying Te Whatu Ora senior management could go too.</p>
        
            <p>Last week the Government appointed a commissioner to take over from Health New Zealand's board.</p>
        
            <p>Finance Minister Nicola Willis revealed on Monday she wrote to Health Minister Shane Reti on 19 March with concerns about the agency's finances.</p>
        
            <p>She said it only became clear over time how bad the problems were. "Only by our officials pushing very very hard, did the full picture emerge."</p>
