            <p>A Wellington garden centre has been broken into twice over the long weekend, leaving the owners feeling uneasy and frustrated.</p>
        
            <p>Thieves broke into Palmers Miramar on Saturday and Sunday night and both times took large pots, heavy concrete bird baths, garden furniture and plants.</p>
        
            <p>Co-owner Katherine Beauchamp said they had been selective and had stolen some of the more expensive items in store.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was disappointing to come to work after a break-in considering how hard her team works.</p>
        
            <p>"We support the community gardens and the prison gardens, so we do support wider community groups so if people need something, we're certainly trying our best to help out. We would prefer people ask rather than help themselves".</p>
        
            <p>Beauchamp said the garden centre was broken into about six times in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got substantial security cameras and floodlights. Not sure whether the floodlights assist in being able to see but it certainly makes it easier for us to identify people... but of course it becomes an aid perhaps in the evening, afterhours because they can see what they're doing".</p>
        
            <p>On social media, Palmers Miramar asked the community if anyone had seen anything suspicious over the weekend to get in touch.</p>
        
            <p>Beauchamp said police are aware of the break-ins and the community had been very supportive and helpful.</p>
        
            <p>"We engaged with the police first off and we're going through that process... We've got a really great local constable. Unfortunately, his resources are very stretched, so we hope to see him at some stage".</p>
        
            <p>"You've got to pick up the pieces and keep going".</p>
