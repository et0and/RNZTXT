            <p>The family of a man who died in the Wellington suburb of Miramar are relieved to hear of progress on the case, as police reveal they have found a link between the homicide and a nearby aggravated burglary.</p>
        
            <p>Abdulhassan Nabizadah, 63, was found critically injured on a street corner at about 2am on 17 March, minutes after police were called to a home just blocks away on Darlington Road, whose occupants had found an intruder in their home.</p>
        
            <p>Nabizadah died in hospital the next day.</p>
        
            <p>A 28-year-old man was later arrested and charged with aggravated burglary in relation to the Darlington Road incident, and appeared in court on 27 March.</p>
        
            <p>Then, on Thursday evening, police revealed they now believed there to be a link between the two cases, and they had confirmed why Nabizadah was in the area that night.</p>
        
            <p>Nabizadah's son John told RNZ the family did not know what link the police had found, or why their father was there - but news of progress from the police was a positive step.</p>
        
            <p>"It is a little bit of a relief," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know they're in the right place, they're doing the best they can."</p>
        
            <p>Detective inspector Nick Pritchard said a large police team had been working on parallel investigations into both incidents.</p>
        
            <p>"We also believe [Nabizadah] was the victim of a robbery," Pritchard said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were still seeking information from the public which could help identify a pedestrian walking from Camperdown Road into Darlington Road at 12.28am.</p>
        
            <p>The person was wearing a light top and dark pants, and police said they could have crucial information.</p>
        
            <p>They were also still seeking the driver of a 2006 silver or grey Mazda 6 seen driving through the Darlington Road/Camperdown Road intersection several times between 11.50pm on Sunday 16 March, and 2.17am on 17 March.</p>
