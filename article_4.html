            <p>An Auckland man has been arrested this week over unlawful video recordings of women and young girls over nearly a decade.</p>
        
            <p>The police say the 40 year-old is facing 42 charges, related to covertly making and possessing intimate visual recordings and objectionable material.</p>
        
            <p>He has also been charged with sexual conduct with a child under 12.</p>
        
            <p>More charges in Operation Frost were possible.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Sergeant Rick Veacock said the investigation, led by Auckland City's Child Exploitation team, has so far identified 22 victims over a period of eight years.</p>
        
            <p>"Search warrants were conducted at addresses in Auckland, Waiheke Island and Taup≈ç last month, culminating in the arrest of a 40-year-old man this week."</p>
        
            <p>The man charged was now before the Auckland District Court.</p>
        
            <p>"While we are not able to comment in detail around these matters before the Court, we are pleased to be at a point where this man can be put before a court," Veacock said.</p>
