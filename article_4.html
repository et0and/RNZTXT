            <p>After a delayed start on Monday, Brian Tamaki's trial for breaches of Covid-19 restrictions has begun.</p>
        
            <p>The controversial Destiny Church leader was charged alongside his wife, Hannah Tamaki, and two others for attending outdoor protests during the Level 3 lockdown in October and November of 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Brian Tamaki and his executive assistant Jennifer Marshall were also charged for organising gatherings.</p>
        
            <p>Dozens of the Tamakis' supporters gathered outside Auckland District Court on Monday morning. They were holding signs that read: "We Stand With Tamaki" and "Make NZ Great Again". Tamaki's arrival prompted cheers.</p>
        
            <p>The trial's start was delayed from 10am to 2:15pm. Their supporters returned in the afternoon, filling the public gallery as the Crown began its opening statement.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaki's lawyer Ron Mansfield KC warned supporters to turn off their phones and take off any hats and sunglasses if they wanted to watch.</p>

            <p>At the time of the protests, outdoor weddings, funerals and tangihanga were limited to 10 people and larger gatherings were prohibited as part of the public health response to the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>"Between September 2021 and October 2021, it is alleged that Brian Tamaki, Hannah Tamaki, Jennifer Marshall, and Kaleb Cave organised and/or attended a series of large public gatherings... in contravention of Level 3 restrictions at the time," senior Crown prosecutor Matthew Nathan said.</p>
        
            <p>The first of these was on 2 October.</p>
        
            <p>"They rallied people online... and encouraged people to participate," Nathan continued.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Brian Tamaki pleaded not guilty and was remanded on bail and banned from encouraging non-compliance with government lockdown orders.</p>
        
            <p>"On the 2nd of October a public gathering took place," Nathan continued. "There were approximately 1000 people in attendance, many were not wearing masks. A stage had been set up... Tamaki spoke on stage and promoted another event taking place on the 16th October 2021."</p>
        
            <p>Nathan said the next protest had 2000 attendees, and was followed by yet another on 30 October with 5000.</p>
        
            <p>Though Brian Tamaki did not attend the protest on 30 October, the Crown alleges Hannah Tamaki attended in his place.</p>
        
            <p>Nathan said the fourth defendant, Kaleb Cave, acted as a master of ceremonies during those events.</p>
        
            <p>Brian Tamaki was also charged for attending another protest on 20 November, 2021.</p>
        
            <p>In January 2022, Tamaki was arrested at his home in Auckland after allegedly breaching his bail conditions. He spent 10 days in jail before being released.</p>
        
            <p>He was filmed at each protest and does not deny attending the demonstrations</p>
        
            <p>"The prosecution allege the organisation of and choice to go, remain at, and actively participate in a non-compliant gathering - particularly as the focal point for that gathering - mean Tamaki is criminally culpable," Nathan said.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be alleged that a reasonable person in Tamaki's position would not remain or encourage other people to attend."</p>
        
            <p>The trial was set to continue throughout the week, with evidence from several witnesses.</p>
