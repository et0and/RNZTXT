            <p>After 97 days behind bars, Roger William Blake is heading home after having his jail term converted to home detention.</p>
        
            <p>In January, Blake was found to have "seized upon the tragedy of the Covid pandemic as a money-making opportunity" by selling bleach as a cure for the virus, which made his company more than $100,000 during the global event.</p>
        
            <p>The public gallery in the Hamilton District Court was packed with the Ngatea man's supporters who witnessed him get jailed for 10 and a half months on charges related to breaches laid by MedSafe under the Medicines Act and obstructing a Ministry of Health officer.</p>
        
            <p>There were also charges of making a false statement about himself and his company possessing, advertising and selling products dubbed "MMS", or Miracle Mineral Solution; essentially chlorine dioxide - bleach - mixed with water.</p>
        
            <p>At the time, Judge Brett Crowley granted leave for the 61-year-old to have his jail term converted to home detention if he co-operated with Corrections in doing the necessary paperwork.</p>
        
            <p>Blake, who has previously gone by several different versions of his name - including "Roger William living man" - could have been out in 96 days if he had confirmed his birth name to Judge Noel Cocurullo on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's Roger William Blake?" Judge Cocurullo asked him, to which Blake - appearing via audio-visual link from Spring Hill Prison - replied, "Yep, that's right, over which I'm power of attorney."</p>
        
            <p>"So you're unable to confirm that you're Roger William Blake," the judge asked him again.</p>
        
            <p>"No I'm Roger William," he replied.</p>
        
            <p>The judge instead changed tack and asked him to confirm his date of birth.</p>
        
            <p>"I was born on that date but the legal entity was birthed at the same point."</p>
        
            <p>Judge Cocurullo said the matter would have to be adjourned so he could come to court in person, but Blake wasn't happy.</p>
        
            <p>"I've got a daughter from Australia waiting to see me at home and I would not be impressed having to wait another month to get this sorted."</p>
        
            <p>"Sir, the problem is of your making," the judge responded. "I have tried to get confirmation of who you are."</p>
        
            <p>Blake was remanded a further night in custody and reappeared before Judge Kiriana Tan on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Blake stood steadfast in maintaining his name was "Roger William" and that he had power of attorney, signed by a barrister, over the entity that is Roger Blake.</p>
        
            <p>A probation officer was soon after able to confirm it was Blake by use of a photo in Corrections' system.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Tan accepted he was the same man and worked out he'd served 97 days behind bars, 28 of which covered a stint before being sentenced.</p>
        
            <p>She converted his jail term to three months' home detention.</p>
