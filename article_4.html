            <p>Police tracked a dirt bike rider to a south Auckland hospital, and discovered an associate wearing a Killer Beez t-shirt.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services responded to an incident in Manurewa on Sunday night where a dirt bike had collided with a car. The dirt bike rider, a gang associate, fled the scene, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police tracked him to a local hospital, where he was found with a patched Killer Beez member.</p>
        
            <p>That man had been wearing a t-shirt showing Killer Beez insignia but had covered it up when entering the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>After speaking with police, the man handed over the t-shirt to officers, with no arrests made.</p>
        
            <p>The incident comes as at least three more people have been arrested in the past 24 hours, for displaying gang patches in public.</p>
        
            <p>The Gangs Act - which came into force last week - bans the display of gang patches in public places.</p>

            <p>Assistant Commissioner Paul Basham said police had arrested three people in Christchurch, Gisborne and west Auckland as part of Operation Nickel.</p>
        
            <p>The car was found and the driver identified as a patched Mangu Kaha member, who had earlier been observed wearing Mangu Kaha trousers in Whakatāne. A 27-year-old man will appear in Gisborne District Court on Monday charged with possession of methamphetamine, possession of an offensive weapon, and displaying gang insignia in public.</p>
        
            <p>He was identified as one of five motorcyclists wearing patches in the Wellsford area early on 21 November.</p>
        
            <p>Police were encouraged by the levels of compliance with the new law, Basham said.</p>
        
            <p>"For example, in Whakatāne over the weekend, Manga Kahu members attending a hui chose to not wear their patches or display any insignia or regalia."</p>
        
            <p>As a result, police did not make any arrests in relation to breaches of the Gangs Act.</p>
