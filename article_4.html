            <p>An appeal by serial rapist Malcolm Rewa in relation to his conviction for the murder of Susan Burdett has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.</p>
        
            <p>Rewa was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2019 after a jury found him guilty of bludgeoning Burdett to death in her Auckland home in 1992.</p>
        
            <p>The 2019 trial was the third time he stood trial for Burdett's murder.</p>
        
            <p>Rewa fought for a retrial of his conviction with the Court of Appeal, which was dismissed in January 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Rewa's lawyers had argued his trial lawyer, Paul Chambers, was "incompetent".</p>
        
            <p>They also argued a witness, whose name and other details have been suppressed by the court, and who was in a sexual relationship with Susan Burdett, had motive to kill her.</p>
        
            <p>After failing to have his conviction overturned Rewa later applied to appeal in the Supreme Court, calling his trial a miscarriage of justice.</p>
        
            <p>A decision from the Supreme Court said his appeal was filed nine months late, but due to the extensive material to consider, this was allowed.</p>
        
            <p>However, his appeal has been dismissed as the Supreme Court said there was no risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>
        
            <p>Teina Pora was wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the rape and murder of Burdett.</p>
        
            <p>Pora was convicted in 1994, found guilty again at a retrial in 2000, but eventually the convictions were quashed by the Privy Council in 2004.</p>
        
            <p>In 2019, Rewa was jailed for the crime.</p>
        
            <p>Rewa is serving a sentence of preventive detention with a minimum non-parole period of 22 years for rape and other offending against 25 women.</p>
