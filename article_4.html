            <p>A memorial service for a migrant worker who died after falling from a height is being held in south Auckland on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Chinese national Jun Jiang came to New Zealand on a work visa to work for Auckland company SD Aluminium.</p>
        
            <p>His wife, Jia Fan, later joined her husband on a partner visa with their 8-year-old daughter.</p>
        
            <p>The 37-year-old fell from a scissor lift while moving aluminium extrusions at the company's Albany warehouse in December.</p>
        
            <p>He died at Auckland City Hospital last week after being on life support for about 10 days.</p>
        
            <p>The service is being held in a funeral house in Wiri, with his family from China attending.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe said last week its investigation was continuing.</p>
