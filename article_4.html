            <p>Health NZ has confirmed six more cases of mpox linked to Queentown's Winter Pride Festival, bringing the total to 11.</p>
        
            <p>Cases were first reported at the festival earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>An additional case that has been reported was someone who contracted the disease overseas.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ's Dr Emma Sherwood says anyone experiencing symptoms, especially a rash, should seek medical advice.</p>
        
            <p>The virus in the Winter Pride cluster is clade II, and not linked to recent clade I cases in Africa.</p>
        
            <p>There are two types of mpox, known as clade I and clade II - both have caused current outbreaks in African countries, with a recent increase in clade I cases in Africa leading to WHO recently declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.</p>
        
            <p>Mpox has mostly affected the following groups, who are at greatest risk of contracting the virus:   </p>
        
            <p>Symptoms of mpox usually show up between 1 and 3 weeks after exposure.</p>
        
            <p>Most people with mpox develop a rash or other skin change. These are known as 'lesions'. Lesions are spots, bumps, blisters or sores.</p>
