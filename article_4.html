            <p>Driving teachers are happy Waka Kotahi is tackling wait times for learners licence tests but they want the agency to encourage more people to learn with professionals.</p>
        
            <p>From Monday, there will be a 10 working day stand-down period for people who fail the test twice in one day.</p>
        
            <p>The re-sit fees were scrapped in October, prompting an increase in the number of people sitting the theory test.</p>
        
            <p>Mark Revill-Johnson from the Institute of Driver Educators said the change would help demand.</p>
        
            <p>"We're absolutely in favour of the initiatives that remove barriers and that's what the removal of reset fees was designed to do, but we're a lot more in favour of initiatives that encourage people to take help from professionals to get them driving in a skilled way, in a safe way."</p>
        
            <p>People who learned to drive safely with a professional instructor were good citizens on the road, Revill-Johnson said.</p>
        
            <p>Revill-Johnson said he hoped the change would motivate people to study rather than hope for the best.</p>
        
            <p>"The purpose of the test is to ensure that you understand the road rules before you actually get out driving the real world. So I don't think putting a stand down period will change whether somebody would pass the test or not, the only thing that would change that is their preparation for sitting the test."</p>
        
            <p>It was encouraging to see the transport agency make tweaks to the licensing system because test wait times have blown out, Revill-Johnson said.</p>
        
            <p>The Automobile Association also welcomed plans for the stand-down period but said it did not go far enough with waiting times to take the test tripling in some areas.</p>
        
            <p>Principal advisor Terry Collins on Saturday said the change to remove re-sit fees in October had the best of intentions, but they were dealing with the fallout as more people were repeating the test, taking up available booking slots.</p>
