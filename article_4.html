            <p>The Court of Appeal has reserved its decision in the Jehovah's Witness Church's case challenging the Abuse in Care inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>In Wellington on Thursday the church appealed a High Court ruling that dismissed its claim to be excluded from the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>The public gallery was packed with members of the church and abuse survivors.</p>
        
            <p>Lawyer Sarah Jerebine began the appeal by challenging the Royal Commission's decision to extend the inquiry's scope from institutional care to trust-based relationships between authority figures and children.</p>
        
            <p>"It becomes a person with authority, not authority to care but just authority, can assume responsibility for a trust-based relationship. We say that is something quite different to what was intended and understood by what this Commission would be looking at."</p>
        
            <p>Jerebine argued the extension was unlawful because it went beyond the original purpose of the inquiry and the Commission's powers.</p>
        
            <p>She said the appellant wanted the court to publicly declare that illegality.</p>
        
            <p>But the legal team representing the government and the Commission argued extending the scope of the inquiry was not unusual.</p>
        
            <p>Andrew Butler KC said government inquiries evolved over time.</p>
        
            <p>"People look at the terms of inquiry as they're evolving dynamic beasts, for want of a phrase, where the scope does not always stay where it opened on day one."</p>
        
            <p>He said expanding the scope had benefited the victims of many faith-based institutions.</p>
        
            <p>The secondary argument by the Jehovah's Witnesses was that the official amendment order to extend the scope was made with improper motive by the government.</p>
        
            <p>It said that motive was to target the church and interfere with their court proceedings.</p>
        
            <p>Butler KC said that was not true.</p>
        
            <p>He said the commission intended to clarify the scope to allow survivors from any faith to come forward and to serve the strong public interest in the inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>"Particularly for the sake of survivors who continue to wait for the final report and progress on the government's redress work programme."</p>
        
            <p>The appeal comes after the High Court decision in October 2023 to dismiss the Jehovah's Witnesses legal bid to get out of being included in the inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>The church maintains it should be exempt because it did not run institutions that cared for children or vulnerable people.</p>
        
            <p>In her judgement at the time Justice Ellis argued the church could not avoid scrutiny.</p>
        
            <p>Jerebine said the faith was not avoiding being investigated, instead it was challenging errors of law.</p>
        
            <p>Justices Cooper, Goddard and Cooke said the court would make a judgment as soon as possible.</p>
        
            <p>Former Jehovah's Witness elder turned advocate Shayne Mechen was at the hearing and hoped the appeal would be quashed.</p>
        
            <p>He said the faith was avoiding being looked into.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only here, but every other country that is involved in court cases, they are trying to avoid having scrutiny on what they consider is their right and their organisation.</p>
        
            <p>"Jehovah's Witnesses will nitpick the law and care very little about the abuse survivors, whether it's mentally, physically or sexually, they don't care."</p>
        
            <p>Mechen said the appeal was frustrating for victims of abuse by the church and was a waste of time and money.</p>
        
            <p>Another survivor Steve Winyard said when people chose to leave the Jehovah's Witnesses they were treated badly.</p>
        
            <p>"I think it [the court case] needs to go ahead a bit more because other countries are coming down on the Jehovah's Witnesses for shunning families.</p>
        
            <p>"Jehovah's Witness parents are kicking their kids out of home at a very young age as soon as they no longer want to be witnesses."</p>
        
            <p>He wanted the court to take a strong stance against the church's treatment of former members.</p>
