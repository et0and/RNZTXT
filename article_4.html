            <p>Parts of the country are in for several days of blustery, southwesterly winds with chilly temperatures and showers as a cold front makes its way up the South Island, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>The winds bring increased risk of severe gales around the southeast coast of the South Island on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Most people can expect below average temperatures and those in breezy regions should expect wind chill.</p>
        
            <p>"Overnight temperatures will be below average, however, due to the wind and cloud we're not forecasting temperatures to drop as low as they did in the second week of May," MetService meteorologist Lewis Ferris said.</p>
