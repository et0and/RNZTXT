        <h2>Scrub fire contained, long traffic delays on SH2 remain</h2>
        <p>
Police received reports of the fire near on SH2 between Tauranga and Katikati shortly before 2pm, and the Transport Agency told drivers to reroute, as there are long queues.

            <p>Firefighters have contained a scrub fire in the Whakamārama area in the Bay of Plenty, which blocked State Highway 2, but long traffic delays remain in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Police have said there were reports of the fire near Te Puna stream received shortly before 2pm.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 2 and some nearby roads were blocked, and police urged people to delay any travel between Tauranga and Katikati.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand's northern shift manager Paul Radden, said crews from five fire stations were called to the scene in the Whakamārama area.</p>
        
            <p>He said the fire was contained shortly before 5pm and two fire crews were still at Te Puna Stream monitoring the situation.</p>
        
            <p>The transport agency said late afternoon that the delays at Te Puna Stream Bridge were expected to be significant, as traffic had been backing up there for several hours already.</p>
        
            <p>Driving the normally short 20 kilometres between Omokoroa and Tauranga could take up to two hours, and it also called on drivers to avoid the area.</p>
