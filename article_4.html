            <p>A man has pleaded guilty to manslaughter and three other charges in a hit and run that threw its victims 40 metres.</p>
        
            <p>Jason Tuitama, who is 24, was charged with hitting two pedestrians on Cable Street, nearTe Papa in Wellington, before driving away just after midnight on the June 18 last year.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared in the dock in Wellington's High Court today holding a bible and a small cross.</p>
        
            <p>Tuitama also pleaded guilty to reckless driving causing injury, failing to stop after a crash and driving while exceeding more than 400 milligrams of alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Dale La Hood acknowledged both the victims families, the surviving victim and Tuitama's whanau.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the hit and run at 1:15am, where one person was seriously hurt and another critical.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier that night, Tuitama had been drinking at a rugby club to celebrate a milestone game for him.</p>
        
            <p>He and his partner, who was sober, decided to drive to Courtenay Place, but he refused to pull over and let her drive when she became concerned.</p>
        
            <p>At around midnight he was speeding on Cable Street and drove pst a red light at the intersection with Taranaki Street and hit two women.</p>
        
            <p>Both victims were thrown 40 metres away from the crossing.</p>
        
            <p>Police later found the car that fled the scene at Evans Bay parade where they arrested Tuitama and his 26 year old partner.</p>
        
            <p>Tuitama recorded a breath test of 993 micrograms, almost four times the legal limit.</p>
        
            <p>Casidhe Maguire died in Wellington Regional Hospital in July last year after being taken to the Intensive Care Unit.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement from the Ministry of Health, it described her as a "really special person" and a valued team member who had many good friends.</p>
        
            <p>In the 28 year old's obituary, her whanau gave their thanks to the staff in Wellington's ICU.</p>
        
            <p>Tuitama was granted bail ahead of his sentencing on the May10 .</p>
