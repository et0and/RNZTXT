            <p>The murder trial of former eye surgeon Philip Polkinghorne has been interrupted by intermittent power cuts at the High Court in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne has pleaded not guilty to the murder of his wife, Pauline Hanna, in their Remuera home in April 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The start of Friday's proceedings were briefly delayed as staff attempted to restart the court's IT systems following a power outage earlier in the morning.</p>
        
            <p>Sergeant Christian Iogha returned to the stand for a third day to be cross examined by Polkinghorne's lawyer, Ron Mansfield KC.</p>
        
            <p>But as Mansfield and Iogha reviewed photos taken at the scene, a second power cut forced court to be adjourned.</p>
        
            <p>As staff attempted to restart their systems a second time, their progress was undone by yet another blackout.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Graham Lang said he still planned to continue with the day's proceedings.</p>
        
            <p>More to come.</p>
