            <p>Auckland Transport has confirmed it will delay changes to overnight on-street parking charges in the city centre.</p>
        
            <p>The plans were set to remove free kerbside parking in the central city outside peak hours, overnight and at weekends from 1 July. Instead, vehicle owners will need to stump up between $2 and $3 an hour.</p>
        
            <p>However, Mayor Wayne Brown had said he had no idea the changes were coming. Deputy mayor Desley Simpson urged AT to go back and consult with affected parties over its new overnight on-street parking changes.</p>
        
            <p>AT chief executive Dean Kimpton previously told Morning Report he personally delivered the news to Brown in April and the plan had been "out there" since 23 April as part of their parking strategy.</p>
        
            <p>The plans were also a result of cost-saving measures AT was looking at, including revenue sources, he said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"If we don't find those savings, the ratepayers - including the business ratepayers inside the central city area - could face up to 3 percent increase on rates."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement on Wednesday, Kimpton apologised to Brown saying they could have done better on keeping him informed.</p>
        
            <p>The delay to overnight charges from 1 July to 1 October would allow them to have further talks with key stakeholders and those most affected, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It also enables us to consider mitigations for those impacted by the changes.</p>
        
            <p>"I have also told the mayor we are sorry and could have done better at keeping him and other important stakeholders sufficiently informed.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge the pressure on residents and business, whilst balancing the need to make city centre parking available and in a way that is consistent with the 'Room to Move' parking strategy adopted by Auckland Transport in May 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"We are going to consider possible mitigations for overnight parking changes."</p>
        
            <p>Heart of the City chief executive Viv Beck welcomed the delay.</p>
        
            <p>"Given the widespread concern, we appreciate that Auckland Transport has made a sensible decision to allow for discussions to be had with those affected. This has created unnecessary anxiety and it's critical that these discussions are open and undertaken with a willingness to consider new ideas to meet people's needs," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Charges for Sundays and public holidays will begin as planned from 1 July.</p>
        
            <p>Wynyard Quarter is exempt from any changes until the Wynyard Crossing pedestrian bridge is operating.</p>
