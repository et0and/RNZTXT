            <p>A resident living near the scene of a fatal e-scooter crash in Auckland says the street is not safe for pedestrians.</p>
        
            <p>A person died following a crash near the corner of Ian McKinnon Drive and Devon Street in Eden Terrace around 11.30pm on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the person was located in a critical condition and CPR was started.</p>
        
            <p>"However, they were pronounced dead a short time later."</p>
        
            <p>The Serious Crash Unit attended the scene and inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the crash were ongoing, police said.</p>

            <p>A resident RNZ spoke to at the scene of the crash said the footpath on Ian McKinnon Drive is too narrow and shared by a cycle lane.</p>
        
            <p>"That bit where you've got pedestrians and cyclists on the same bit of road, you've got scooters or whatever going at 40 kilometres an hour, and people walking along in the dark.</p>
        
            <p>"Bad things can happen unfortunately and this is a tragic incident."</p>

            <p>He said the best way to prevent crashes on footpaths was to create cycleways for scooters and bikes.</p>
        
            <p>On 16 September 2019, Toben John Hunt died after crashing on a Lime e-scooter.</p>
        
            <p>His death sparked a conversation about the safety of e-scooters and they were temporarily taken off Auckland streets.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, Auckland Business Chamber chief executive Simon Bridges was hospitalised after an e-scooter accident left him with a broken wrist and badly grazed face.</p>
