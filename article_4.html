            <p>An investigation is underway into the death of an inmate at Christchurch Men's Prison on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Prison director Jo Harrex said staff made every effort to save the man, but were unable to revive him.</p>
        
            <p>She said there was no indication his death was suspicious. Police had been advised and were notifying his next of kin.</p>
        
            <p>Harrex said all deaths in custody were referred to the coroner and the Corrections Inspectorate for separate investigations.</p>
        
            <p>If it is an emergency and you feel like you or someone else is at risk, call 111.</p>
