            <p>People at a social housing complex in Christchurch are shocked by an unexplained death at the property, with one neighbour saying she feels "sick to her stomach".</p>
        
            <p>Reports suggested a child had died at the complex on Barrington Street in Spreydon on Wednesday afternoon, although police would not confirm the age of the person who died.</p>
        
            <p>A child's scooter could be seen outside the home.</p>
        
            <p>A neighbour, who did not want to be named, told RNZ she saw emergency services in the area, but did not hear a commotion.</p>
        
            <p>"Our other flatmate came back home from work and said that there were heaps of ambulances and cops across the road," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There was a guy standing, like facing towards the fence with his hands above his head and the cop standing behind him.</p>
        
            <p>"Our other flatmate was speaking to a neighbour and they said that there were heaps of ambulances, cops, fire trucks.</p>
        
            <p>"They also mentioned that there were heaps of like, little kids on scooters around the area."</p>

            <p>The woman said she would be distressed to learn that a child had died.</p>
        
            <p>"That makes me feel sick to the stomach," she said.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday morning, police said they were treating the death as unexplained.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are continuing to make enquiries into a death at an address on Barrington Street yesterday," they said.</p>
        
            <p>"At this time, the death is being treated as unexplained."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Kāinga Ora regional director for Canterbury Liz Krause said the agency's thoughts were with the friends and whānau of the person who died.</p>
        
            <p>"While this death is under police investigation, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further."</p>
