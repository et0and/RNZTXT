            <p>New aviation levies proposed by Fire and Emergency are excessive and unfair, a group representing the industry says.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) plans to extend its fire insurance levy - currently imposed on homes and other property including cars - to domestic aircraft like planes and helicopters, staring to July 2026.</p>
        
            <p>Although the proposal is for just 11.51 cents per $100 of insurance, Aviation Industry Association chief executive Simon Wallace says it adds up to a significant cost.</p>
        
            <p>"For a rescue helicopter, that's $9000 in levies per year. For an aircraft valued at $10 million it's $11,500, and it just goes up from here. These are very excessive levies."</p>
        
            <p>He said the aviation industry had previously been exempt from the levies because of its "minimal" use of emergency services.</p>
        
            <p>"Domestic aviation is a negligible user of FENZ services," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There were less than 40 callouts to aviation last year, out of 88,000 [total callouts], so 0.045 percent of all callouts come from domestic aviation."</p>
        
            <p>The fire insurance levy for homes was capped to $100,000 of insurance. That meant homeowners with fire insurance would never pay more than $106 per year, or $119.50 when the levy rate is adjusted in July this year.</p>
        
            <p>But Wallace said the proposed levies on aircraft would be uncapped, and aviation businesses would be charged tens of thousands.</p>
        
            <p>"If there is to be a levy at all, it should be capped," he said. "FENZ needs to come back and talk to the sector about it, which hasn't happened."</p>
        
            <p>He said the levies would not just apply to commercial airlines, but the entire aviation industry.</p>
        
            <p>"Whether it's an agriculture operator, a rescue helicopter, a flight training school. They will all come under what we think is an excessive, and uncapped, levy," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency NZ and the government had been unresponsive, Simon said.</p>
        
            <p>"[We] lodged a submission last Friday, we have written to Minister of Internal Affairs Brooke van Velden, we've asked for a meeting with her... we have heard nothing to date."</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency has been approached for comment.</p>
