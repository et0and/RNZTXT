            <p>Local Māori have placed a rāhui on part of Lake Taupō following the suspected drowning of a jetskier on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō Police Senior Sergeant Andy Livingstone said they received a report around 12.40pm on Sunday of a person or people on a jetski in trouble.</p>
        
            <p>"While one person and the jetski made it to shore with assistance from Police and Taupō Coastguard, a second person sadly did not, and was last seen struggling in the water," Livingstone said on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"The Police National Dive Squad has been notified and is expected to deploy [Monday]."</p>
        
            <p>He said Tūwharetoa Maori Trust Board had been advised and local hapū were assisting to support those involved.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday night, Nukuhau Marae said it had placed a rāhui on the surrounding area from 8.45pm.</p>
        
            <p>It covered "from the pūau down past Paenoa Te Ākau to Te Moenga Bay Boat Ramp near the Acacia Bay shops".</p>
        
            <p>The marae said it would "work with the whānau pani and the police to determine the length of the rāhui".</p>
        
            <p>"Please observe the rāhui and refrain from swimming, fishing or kai gathering in the marked area until further notice."</p>
