            <p>Enrolment figures show international student numbers all but recovered at universities last year.</p>
        
            <p>However, schools and polytechnics had about half as many foreign enrolments as before the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>Education New Zealand said there were 69,135 enrolments last year, up from 2022's low of 41,360.</p>
        
            <p>However, the figure was well below the nearly 116,000 enrolments in 2019, before the pandemic began.</p>
        
            <p>Education New Zealand said one student might enrol more than once so the actual number of students might be lower than the number of enrolments.</p>
        
            <p>It said universities had 29,065 enrolments last year, about 4800 fewer than in 2019 but similar to enrolment totals in 2017 and 2018.</p>
        
            <p>China provided a third of last year's enrolments, India 17 percent and Japan 10 percent.</p>
        
            <p>However, at universities 50 percent of foreign students last year were Chinese, one of the highest percentages on record.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pukenga had 8620 international enrolments, about half its pre-pandemic figure of 16640. The total included 2135 Chinese students and 3380 from India</p>
        
            <p>Schools had 14,125 enrolments compared to 23,577 in 2019 while private tertiary institutions had 7954 enrolments, down from 13708 in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>English language schools had 9569 enrolments which was equivalent to a third of the sector's pre-pandemic 2019 total of 28,473 enrolments.</p>
        
            <p>However, Education New Zealand said English language schools' total represented a 511 percent increase over their 2022 total of 1565.</p>
