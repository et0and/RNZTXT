        <h2>Archaeologists called in after waka uncovered</h2>
        <p>
"With the vulnerability of the waka to the elements, time is of the essence," Heritage New Zealand says.
</p>
        
            <p>
Some exposed pieces of the waka have already recovered from the site, with larger pieces expected to be uncovered.

            <p>The partial remains of a waka have been found on Rēkohu Wharekauri Chatham Island.</p>
        
            <p>Manatū Taonga Ministry for Culture and Heritage said it was working closely with landowners, as well as the Hokotehi Moriori Trust, Ngāti Mutunga ki Wharekauri, Moriori Imi Settlement Trust, Heritage New Zealand and the Department of Conservation, to ensure that the recovery and conservation of the waka was undertaken appropriately.</p>
        
            <p>"We are very grateful to the local family for informing us of the find and caring for the exposed waka and recovered pieces. They have been instrumental in securing the site and in the ongoing monitoring of the waka", Pou Mataaho o Te Hononga Deputy Secretary Māori Crown Partnerships Glenis Philip-Barbara said.</p>
        
            <p>"Our focus is on being guided by imi and iwi to ensure that the waka is protected for the benefit of future generations and is allowed to tell its own story."</p>
        
            <p>Manatū Taonga had also engaged archaeologists, conservators and other professionals to support this work.</p>
        
            <p>
The waka was discovered buried in the sand dunes in a remote part of the island.

            <p>Heritage New Zealand issued an archaeological authority to Manatū Taonga to allow for the recovery of the visible pieces of the waka that remain in situ, from January.</p>
        
            <p>Heritage New Zealand spokesperson and kaihautū Dean Whiting said this was to ensure the recovery of critical information while respecting the involvement of imi and iwi.</p>
        
            <p>"With the vulnerability of the waka to the elements, time is of the essence, and we are committed to facilitating its careful investigation and recovery," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Manatū Taonga has issued a public notice on its website which gives interested parties 60 days to apply for ownership of the waka under the Protected Objects Act 1975.</p>
