            <p>Police family and friends are still looking for a Wellington man missing for more than a week, and there are fears for his safety.</p>
        
            <p>George Dominic, known as Niko, was last seen at the end of Muritai Road, near Burdan's Gate in Eastbourne about 5.30pm on 29 May.</p>
        
            <p>Dominic is described as being of Tokelauan descent, in his 40s, and was last seen wearing a grey top and dark pants.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, police reiterated their public appeal for information.</p>
        
            <p>"We ask anyone who may have been in the area at the time he went missing, or has any CCTV or dashcam footage which may be of assistance to get in touch."</p>
        
            <p>Last week, police launched a search and rescue operation, which included the Maritime Unit and Police National Dive Squad, in their efforts to find Dominic.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information can call police on 105, with the file reference number 240529/4406.</p>
