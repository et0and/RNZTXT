            <p>Hundreds of Cantabrians struggling to make ends meet will have a Christmas to celebrate, thanks to the kindness of strangers.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch's Methodist Mission has been a hive of holiday cheer today, as donated Christmas hampers were dropped off and given to those unable to put a meal on the table.</p>
        
            <p>Volunteers dressed as reindeer and elves helped unload car after car filled with boxes of Christmas lunch, presents and festive treats - each specially made for the family receiving it.</p>

            <p>This year, 165 hampers were being given out - with more than 400 children among the recipients.</p>
        
            <p>Andrew's kids were included.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a single dad and things get hard over Christmas and these guys are helping me out; they've helped me out over the last couple of years. One hundred percent it makes a difference, it takes a load off, y'know," he said.</p>

            <p>One single mum of four had just welcomed her first grandchild while transitioning off the benefit.</p>
        
            <p>"[It's been] very, very tough, off and on while I've been taken off the benefit. I've had to go to work but I only can do so many hours because my youngest is still at school. So yeah, it's really, really, really hard at the moment, as it is for many other families as well," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She is stoked to be getting a hamper.</p>
        
            <p>"Wow, we're going to have a Christmas to say the least. I'm over the moon to be honest, this is going to help so much."</p>
        
            <p>Zack said the year ran away on his family and Christmas became a nice to have - until they got put in touch with the Methodist Mission.</p>
        
            <p>"We've just been roughly getting some support for our boy and we haven't been able to fully fulfil our end of the Christmas year with a bunch of things going on, building a house and all that carry on. These guys are really helping us out here by making this for us this year," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Each package had been lovingly put together by donors looking to share the season's goodwill.</p>

            <p>For Emmett Williamson's family, gifting a hamper had become a Christmas tradition.</p>
        
            <p>"We decided quite a few years ago that we've been lucky in life and the things that have been presented to us and we wanted to pass some of that on to the less fortunate," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"So we forgo giving each other presents, and decided we'll give someone else a nice Christmas. And it makes it a bit easier too, you don't have to worry about what to buy your in-laws or whatever."</p>
        
            <p>Nicki Lover was also a long-time donor - she organised everyone in her office to give items.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just a wonderful idea, it's really really awesome. Our whole team of about 15 get behind it, we get vouchers as well as the groceries and presents for the adults and the children. We also do Pak'n'Save vouchers and sometimes movie vouchers to just make it a real good experience for the whole of Christmas and January for our family."</p>
        
            <p>Glenda Marshall who is the City Mission's Support a Family coordinator said families often received a hamper if they have had a tough year or were struggling financially.</p>

            <p>There had been no shortage of people willing to donate in the 15 years the programme had been running, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This year has been as good as any other year. In fact, we've had more than enough donors and lots of new donors who are individual people who have just decided to donate, it's fantastic," Marshall said.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody loves it. The donors love this day, they love giving, the families are so grateful and for the staff, it's a really nice way to end the year."</p>
        
            <p>And she was right - each car that left the parking lot was full of smiling people calling out Merry Christmas as they drove off.</p>
