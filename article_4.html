            <p>Five people were injured at the Avondale Christmas Parade today after a Burger Fuel-branded car hit two pedestrians, with three occupants of the vehicle - including two children - then assaulted by people in the crowd.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City District Commander Inspector Jacqui Whittaker said the vehicle, which was part of the parade, experienced a "mechanical malfunction" at about 11.45am and rolled slowly into two pedestrians standing in front of the stage.</p>
        
            <p>The two pedestrians received moderate to serious injuries and were taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>A Whau Local Board member said she heard the MC of the Avondale Christmas parade yelling stop shortly before the car hit pedestrians.</p>
        
            <p>Local Board member Catherine Farmer was at the parade and described hearing the parade's MC yelling 'stop' and telling people to call an ambulance.</p>
        
            <p>"The MC started yelling out 'stop, stop, go back, stop!' and then I heard him say 'we've got to get Fire and Emergency here, we've got to get ambulances,'" she said.</p>
        
            <p>"And then there was just a general melee."</p>
        
            <p>Whittaker said a small group of people took it upon themselves to retaliate.</p>
        
            <p>"Three people - including two children - were pulled from the vehicle and assaulted."</p>
        
            <p>They received minor injuries and were treated at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A NZME reporter at the scene said the crowd were jumping on the bonnet and smashing their fists on it and that MƒÅori wardens had to hold them back.</p>
        
            <p>Whittaker said police were working to identify those responsible for the assault, and were working closely with the parade organisers, and the driver of the vehicle and the company.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand this was an unsettling event, where multiple people have become injured, and not the end to the parade which was wanted."</p>
        
            <p>Whittaker said police wanted to send a clear message: "Please do not take matters into your own hands."</p>
        
            <p>"As this incident demonstrates, something may not be what it seems to you at first, and others stepping in can result in unnecessary injuries and further distress."</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Hata Hone St John said: "Hato Hone St John were notified of a motor vehicle incident in Avondale at 11:43 and responded three ambulances, one rapid response unit, and one manager to the scene."</p>
        
            <p>The Santa parade, the first in the area, was set down to run from 11am to 2pm.</p>
