            <p>Auckland commuters are being warned of serious delays after a vehicle collided with a power pole in Glen Eden this morning.</p>
        
            <p>West Coast Road was blocked in both directions between Bowers and Pleasant Roads, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Commuters are asked to avoid the area or expect significant delays."</p>
        
            <p>The driver was not seriously injured and no other vehicles were involved, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"It appears a vehicle has collided with a power pole just after 5am, which has caused some power-disruption in the area."</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport said buses 152 and 154 were being detoured because of the crash.</p>
        
            <p>Vector's online power outage map also showed a significant unplanned outage in the area.</p>
        
            <p>The power outage stretched about 4km between Sunnylaw Place and Hepburn Road.</p>
