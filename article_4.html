            <p>The family of a missing 13-year-old girl from Gisborne say they have "no words to describe how worried they are".</p>
        
            <p>Police said Sophia was last seen late on Saturday evening in Whataupoko.</p>
        
            <p>Friends and wider family of the teenager have not heard from her which was unusual, area manager Darren Leigh-Paki said.</p>
        
            <p>"Every minute feels like an hour," Sophia's family said.</p>
        
            <p>"Sophia, you are loved by so many, and we just want to hold you in our loving arms again - our hearts are breaking.</p>
        
            <p>"Please, if you see this, let one of us know you are safe or just come home, darling."</p>
        
            <p>Sophia was wearing a light grey converse hoody and charcoal grey trackpants.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were growing increasingly concerned for her welfare and urgently wanted to find her.</p>
        
            <p>The public were being asked to contact police if they have seen the teenager.</p>
