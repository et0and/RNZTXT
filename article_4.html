        <h2>Weather: Strong winds bring 'lacklustre' Summer</h2>
        <p>
The east side of the country should be prepared for cloud, wind and showers in the coming days, according to MetService.

            <p>Strong winds and cloudy weather are set to continue for eastern parts of the country, MetService has said, while the west will get to experience the better Summer weather.</p>
        
            <p>Southerlies would persist into next week, MetService meteorologist Alec Holden said, as a low pressure system to the east and a ridge of high pressure to the west remained in place.</p>
        
            <p>"The continuing southerlies will make it feel like summer is still lacklustre in the east with cloud and showers washing in and out, but summer is alive and well elsewhere."</p>
        
            <p>Holden noted Christchurch was yet to reach its climatic average daily maximum temperature of 22 degrees celsius in January, with its highest forecasted temperature in the next seven days reaching just 19 degrees.</p>
        
            <p>No severe weather is forecast for the country over the next couple of days, Holden said, however, near constant strong to gale southerly winds were expected for the Chatham Islands.</p>
        
            <p>Cloud and isolated showers were expected along the east coast on Friday with conditions remaining fine elsewhere, apart from a few afternoon showers about Waikato northward and the ranges of the South Island, Holden said.</p>
        
            <p>"That said, tomorrow cloud breaks up in the east making it a good day to get the washing done for east coasters, but a bad washing day for Southlanders as showers develop around midday when a weak front approaches from the southwest."</p>
        
            <p>Winds would pick up again in the east on Saturday, Holden said, but showers were predicted to remain largely offshore.</p>
        
            <p>Holden said conditions should be mainly fine elsewhere on Saturday, making it a good day for the Black Caps match against Sri Lanka at Auckland's Eden Park.</p>
        
            <p>"Looking long range, this status quo of southerlies in the east and more summery weather in the west looks to continue at least until the end of next week."</p>
        
            <p>This summer looks set to be wetter and windier than usual due to a change in air flow patterns, according to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research</p>
        
            <p>(NIWA).</p>
        
            <p>In NIWA's seasonal climate outlook from January through to March, a La Niña watch would also remain in place.</p>
        
            <p>La Niña refers to a cooling of the tropical Pacific Ocean and the subsequent shift in global weather patterns, including a strengthening of moist easterly winds blowing towards New Zealand, and a subsequent increase in cloud development and rain over the longitudes.</p>
        
            <p>It is only the second time in 75 years that a La Niña onset has arrived in summer.</p>
        
            <p>It usually forms in winter, peaks in late spring, and then gradually weakens through Summer.</p>
