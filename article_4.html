            <p>Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming chose to work her final New Year's shift to help support her colleagues, the police commissioner says.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming, an officer for 38 years, died after being hit by a car in the early hours of New Year's Day in Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>She was farewelled by hundreds at Nelson's Trafalgar Centre on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>During the service, police commissioner Richard Chambers spoke about Fleming's loyalty to her career and the care she had for the staff she was in charge of.</p>
        
            <p>As a senior officer, Fleming did not have to work the New Year's Eve to New Year's Day shift, Chambers said, but she wanted to anyway, to support her staff.</p>
        
            <p>Her shift began the same way she had many times over the last 38 years and seven months, Chambers said.</p>

            <p>"At the start of shift, Lyn produced a range of snacks for her colleagues to help keep them going through the night shift.</p>
        
            <p>"She cared deeply about her staff."</p>
        
            <p>While getting ready she made a comment about how sore her feet would be at the end of the shift, Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>What happened during that shift was a "senseless" and "unprovoked" act of violence, Chambers said.</p>
        
            <p>Chambers told Fleming's children, Aren and Rayna Olsen, their mum had been a "superstar".</p>
        
            <p>"Your mum has paid the ultimate sacrifice, and for that I am sorry".</p>

            <p>Fleming was the first policewoman to be killed in the line of duty in New Zealand - she was described by loved ones as "humble" and a matriarch of the Nelson Police Station.</p>
        
            <p>Fleming's casket was carried out of the funeral service by her Nelson team - Sergeant Adrian Cupit, Sergeant Nigel Orpwood, Sergeant Craig Clayworth, Sergeant Tony Esera, Sergeant Alana Kane, Sergeant Tim Wincer and Senior Sergeant Byron Reid.</p>
        
            <p>A number of officers performed a haka, Ko Te Uru Pounamu, in her honour outside.</p>
