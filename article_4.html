            <p>A man has been arrested in Porirua after another turned up at a hospital with gunshot wounds, police say.</p>
        
            <p>The wounded man turned up at an unnamed hospital on Thursday, where he underwent surgery and is now in a stable condition, Detective Inspector Haley Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed the firearms incident happened in Porirua and "the victim and the offender are known to each other," Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>Officers searched a Porirua address on Friday, and arrested a 55-year-old man. Charges are expected to follow.</p>
        
            <p>"The investigation is ongoing and the Porirua community should expect to see an increased Police presence in the area," Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information about the incident was asked to call Police on 105, or to visit their Update Report page online at 105.police.govt.nz and quote file number 240111/9979. Information could also be provided anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, or on their website.</p>
