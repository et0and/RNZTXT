        <h2>Fisherman lucky to be alive after rescue, livesavers say</h2>
        <p>
The two-metre swells and incoming tide were too extreme to get a rescue boat close enough, but swimmers and a jetski were able to step in.

            <p>Surf Life Saving says two fishermen are lucky to be alive after a difficult rescue at Auckland's Bethells Beach on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>A fisherman was swept off the rocks at O'Neill's Bay just before 7.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Two others were able to bring the unconscious man back onto the rocks, and one went to the beach to call for help.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for Surf Life Saving said the two-metre swells and incoming tide were too extreme to get a rescue boat close enough, but rescue swimmers and a jetski were able to save the two remaining fishermen.</p>
        
            <p>They said the men were lucky to survive considering they were not wearing lifejackets.</p>
