            <p>Another Wellington high school has had to close multiple buildings due to seismic reports.</p>
        
            <p>Onslow College has announced an immediate closure of the gym (Block Q) and O Block after updated seismic assessments found both buildings had structural elements that are at or below 30 percent of the New Building Standard (NBS).</p>
        
            <p>In August, Wellington Girls' College closed for multiple days after it was revealed the biggest teaching block at the school was earthquake-prone.</p>
        
            <p>Onslow College said the gym previously had a seismic rating of 70 percent of the NBS and O Block had a rating of 55 percent.</p>
        
            <p>It received the new assessment reports on at 4pm on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The key risks identified were:</p>
        
            <p>A building with a rating of less than 67 percent NBS is deemed to be an "earthquake risk", and a rating less than 34 percent NBS means the building is "earthquake prone".</p>
        
            <p>Onslow College have decided to close both buildings until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>"Ensuring the safety and well-being of our community is our top priority while further investigation and design work is completed."</p>
        
            <p>It said it is facing a severe classroom shortage in the coming weeks with the two buildings unavailable, and is requesting that all students, including learning support, work from home on Tuesday 29 October to allow them time to address it.</p>
        
            <p>"We will be in touch on Tuesday with arrangements for Wednesday and the following days. We appreciate your patience and cooperation as we navigate these changes.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand that this decision is challenging and appreciate your patience and cooperation as we navigate these changes.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge that this is a significant adjustment, and we are grateful for the students' flexibility and cooperation. Please know that at all times, our decisions are made with our students' safety in mind."</p>
