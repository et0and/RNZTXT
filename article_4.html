            <p>One home has been evacuated as a 600-metre-wide vegetation fire rips through a remote part of southeast Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said it responded to the blaze in Kawakawa Bay just after 1pm with multiple fire trucks, water tankers, and two helicopters.</p>
        
            <p>The agency said they are working to control the fire near Raukura Point and police said they have helped evacuate one house in the area.</p>
        
            <p>A witness near the fire, Lucan McArdle, said it appears to have started on what had been a stand of pines.</p>
        
            <p>"When we first arrived we could see the fire actually happening.</p>
        
            <p>"It was on the stumps from the old pine trees that were cut down a few years ago. Those were kind of what was on fire, and yeah, it would have been all the pine needles which have gone up."</p>
        
            <p>McArdle said it looks like the worst of the blaze is over.</p>
