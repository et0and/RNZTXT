            <p>Some speed-safety cameras around the country, particularly in the Wellington and Otago, are temporarily out of action, as Police hand them over to the NZ Transport Agency.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA is taking over camera management, after a 2019 cabinet decision.</p>
        
            <p>As part of that rollout, most fixed speed cameras in Wellington, and all of them in Otago and Southland have stopped issuing infringements - for now. Fines are still being given out from two fixed speed cameras in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>"Before cameras go live on our network, they go through a rigorous testing process," NZTA said. "Other organisations complete the tests and issue certificates."</p>
        
            <p>Cameras will not issue infringements while in testing mode.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are continuing to enforce speeds with officer-issued infringement notices."</p>

            <p>Two Canterbury and four Auckland spot speed cameras were also being tested, bringing the total to 17 cameras across the country.</p>
        
            <p>The transport agency would not say how long the cameras would be out of action for.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA began scaling up the transfer of the speed cameras to its network in July 2024.</p>
        
            <p>Twenty-five cameras, mostly in Auckland, along with a small number in Northland and Waikato, have been transferred to its network so far.</p>
        
            <p>During the transfer period, the transport agency and police both issued infringement notices from different safety cameras.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA will issue all notices from cameras, once the transfer was complete. They will also take over responsibility for mobile cameras from Police during 2025.</p>
        
            <p>Sixty-two speed-safety cameras and 47 red-light cameras operate nationwide.</p>
        
            <p>Camera upgrades will also be done while cameras are being transferred to NZTA.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington residents will notice that the city's highest-grossing speed camera, located at Ngauranga Gorge, has been temporarily removed for equipment upgrades and testing.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect the camera to be operational again soon," said a transport agency spokesperson.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has also seen parts missing from a speed camera located on State Highway 1 at Thorndon.</p>
