        <h2>Dad bods on display at Hamilton's Meatstock festival</h2>
        <p>
Along slide the fire pits and slabs of steak will be one of Meatstock's biggest crowd-pleasers - the dad bod contest.

            <p>Fire up, because NZ's biggest barbecue festival is about to get grilling.</p>
        
            <p>Billed as a carnivore's paradise, the two-day Meatstock festival gets underway on Saturday at Mystery Creek, near Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>But it's not just the menu that's spicy. Along slide the fire pits and slabs of steak is one of Meatstock's biggest crowd-pleasers - the dad bod contest.</p>
        
            <p>"The best way to describe it is ultimately it's a celebration of just normality and the regular bloke, which is what I love about it," Meatstock organiser Reyan Fernando told Checkpoint on Friday.</p>

            <p>"You're comfortable with who you are and what you've developed over the years. It takes a bit of work and a bit of commitment to get yourself a dad bod, and I think it's literally just how well you present it - being completely comfortable in the body you are in, basically."</p>
        
            <p>While one previous winner went "full commitment" and stripped down to just his "blue leopard-print underwear and a cowboy hat", Fernando recommends just ditching the shirt and showing the crowd what you've got.</p>
        
            <p>But if you have a six-pack and muscles, don't bother.</p>
        
            <p>"Nope. That's the exact opposite of what a dad bod is."</p>
        
            <p>Meatstock also hosts contests for mullets and hairy chests.</p>
        
            <p>"Hairy chest is probably the only one I reckon that you kind of win whether you have a personality or not - if you've got the hairiest chest, you just win, basically. It doesn't come down to style."</p>

            <p>Meatstock runs for two days, and everyone is welcome - but if you're vegan, expect to go hungry.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't think there's much there at all," Fernando laughed. "There's probably a couple of salads here and thereâ€¦ you're coming to a festival that's pretty much about meat."</p>
