            <p>An Air New Zealand flight from Christchurch to Auckland on Monday afternoon was turned around after the aircraft experienced a hydraulic system issue.</p>
        
            <p>The national carrier said the issue on board flight NZ542 was identified shortly after takeoff, and the return service was also cancelled as a result.</p>
        
            <p>The plane has landed safely at Christchurch Airport.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Air New Zealand said: "The safety of our people and our customers is our utmost priority" and is rebooking affected customers on the next available flights.</p>
        
            <p>The airline is thanking people for their patience.</p>
