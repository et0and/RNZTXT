            <p>The lead singer of a renowned New Zealand indie band says they are excited about checking off another item from their bucket list - playing on Coachella.</p>
        
            <p>The Beths have been announced in the line-up of the iconic festival, held in California, set for April this year.</p>
        
            <p>The band, which hails from Auckland, will be sharing the stage with the likes of Lana Del Rey, Doja Cat, Tyler the Creator and Blur.</p>
        
            <p>Lead singer Liz Stokes told Morning Report the opportunity was once in a lifetime.</p>
        
            <p>"It's pretty exciting, it's kind of a bucket list festival to play."</p>
        
            <p>The concert was also an opportunity to experience the festival.</p>
        
            <p>"We play on Friday and the first week we will stick around and get to watch everything," Stokes said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you're touring, kind of working, you don't normally get to go to other people's shows. So this is your one opportunity to do so."</p>
        
            <p>She was excited to share the stage with big names.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm excited to see Doja Cat and Lana del Rey, but I have to go through all the other artists on the line-up, because there are so many of them."</p>
        
            <p>But she reckons she will be okay on handling any nerves on stage.</p>
        
            <p>The Coachella Festival will be from 12 to 21 April at the Empire Polo Grounds in Indio, California.</p>
