            <p>A group of overseas tourists were rescued after becoming trapped on Thursday between the tide and steep cliffs while walking to the gannet colony at Cape Kidnappers.</p>
        
            <p>Police, Surf Lifesaving and Coastguard had conducted exercises there in the past for this precise scenario, which led to a rapid response and successful recovery.</p>
        
            <p>Police said that when the group realised they were trapped, they stopped at one of the few places along the coastline where they could be safe from the rising tide.</p>
        
            <p>Surf Lifesaving's Inflatable Rescue Boat (IRB) was able to get in close enough to extract the group, before passing them on to Coastguard who were able to complete the rescue and take the group back to safety.</p>
        
            <p>None of the tourists were injured.</p>
        
            <p>Police said, however, that if the circumstances had been different, the outcome could have been tragic.</p>
        
            <p>There are warning signs at the beach around Clifton and at the beginning of the walk, advising walkers to check tide times, walking times and fitness levels before attempting the trip to the gannet colony.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a timely reminder for people to do their research before heading out for any shoreline or wilderness walks, and to take into account all warning signs along the way," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We would also like to ... commend the response by Surf Lifesaving and Coastguard volunteers, with a professional response leading to a successful recovery."</p>
