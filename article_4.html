            <p>Police have released the name of the woman whose body was found in a burning car on Ripiro Beach, south of Dargaville, on Monday 9 September.</p>
        
            <p>She was 35-year-old Jasmaine Corin Reihana from Paihia, in the Bay of Islands.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Al Symonds, of Northland CIB, said enquiries into the circumstances behind her death were continuing.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are supporting the whƒÅnau of the deceased at this difficult time, who we will continue to keep updated as the investigation continues," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand this was a distressing incident for those involved and the wider community. We'd like to reassure those affected we have a dedicated team following positive lines of enquiry, and those involved will be identified and held to account for Jasmaine's death."</p>
        
            <p>Symonds also repeated his call for anyone who was on or near Ripiro Beach, close to Glink's Gully, between 2pm on Sunday 8 September and 9am on Monday 9 September, to contact police.</p>
        
            <p>Reihana's body was found by firefighters responding to reports of a car fire on the beach, a few kilometres south of Glink's Gully.</p>
        
            <p>They alerted police, who launched a homicide enquiry and carried out detailed scene investigations at the beach and a home in the nearby town to Te Kopuru.</p>
        
            <p>Last week police said they were speaking to a person of interest, and were not looking for anyone else.</p>
        
            <p>At that time they also called for sightings of a 2012 grey Ford Ranger, registration GJC586, and a white or light grey 2001 Toyota Harrier, registration FYR31.</p>
        
            <p>Both vehicles were in the Te Kopuru area, south of Dargaville, on Sunday and Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Police also wanted to hear from anyone who saw a person riding a quad bike on Pinaki or Pouto Roads around that time.</p>
