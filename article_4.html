            <p>A 49-year-old New Zealand woman has died in the Cook Islands while on holiday in a water-based incident.</p>
        
            <p>A Cook Islands Police spokesperson said police received an emergency call shortly after 3pm Cook Islands local time Tuesday (Wednesday NZ time).</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said the women was responsive at the incident site at Avaavaroa Passage - which is a popular tourist attraction for swimming with turtles - but was pronounced dead at the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>In December, a 50-year-old New Zealand man died in Avaavaroa Passage, which is notorious for drownings in the Cook Islands.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson told RNZ Pacific police are still investigating further details, including if the woman was part of a turtle tour when the incident occurred.</p>
        
            <p>They said police are giving the family space who are at their accommodation in Rarotonga.</p>
