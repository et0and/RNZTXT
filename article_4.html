            <p>Christchurch Airport has unveiled plans for a major upgrade of its terminal for the first time since it opened in 2013.</p>
        
            <p>The airport said the project would deliver 12 new eateries, new retail spaces, upgraded bathrooms, a new parent's room, a remodelled food court and a large children's play area.</p>
        
            <p>It would also include more self-service kiosks and interactive screens.</p>
        
            <p>Airport chief executive Justin Watson said the upgrade should be completed by December with predictions that visitor numbers would be even higher than last summer.</p>
        
            <p>"Qantas, China Southern, Cathay Pacific, Fiji Airways and United Airlines have already confirmed they will all be back flying summer services to the city and they're growing their capacity. For example, Qantas will have an extra 175,000 seats and China Southern is boosting its capacity by 20,000 seats," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Last summer season (from November to March) we had 2.7 million passenger movements at Christchurch Airport. We're on track to top that next summer season and it's awesome to know the terminal will be refreshed and ready to welcome our visitors with some of our best manaakitanga and offerings yet."</p>
        
            <p>Business Canterbury chief executive Leeann Watson says Christchurch Airport was an important engine room for the Canterbury economy.</p>
        
            <p>"This investment is a win for the region's businesses. It will bring additional visitors to our region and, position the region and the South Island well for future growth," she said.</p>
        
            <p>In February, Christchurch Airport hit pause on its proposed international airport in Central Otago.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020, the company bought 750 hectares of farmland in Tarras in hopes of building a runway for flights from Australia, the South Pacific, and Southeast Asia.</p>
