            <p>Fire and Emergency says it has twice before attended suspicious fires at an abandoned Levin building destroyed in a blaze overnight - most recently just over a month ago.</p>
        
            <p>Crews alerted to the fire just before 4am today found the former Garden View resthome on Bath Street well involved when they arrived.</p>
        
            <p>ManawatÅ«-Whanganui assistant commander Craig Gold said crews were familiar with the two-storey property, and knew it was already scheduled for demolition.</p>
        
            <p>He said 80 percent of the building was destroyed, with just two small walls still standing.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency spokesperson said, at its peak, six fire appliances, a ladder truck, and a command unit attended from six fire stations.</p>
        
            <p>Now two fire trucks are attending and one crew will be present for much of the day.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson said the fire was being treated as suspicious.</p>
