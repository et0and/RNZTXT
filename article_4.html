        <h2>Water meters identify major leaks, postpone pump station upgrade</h2>
        <p>
One property in the New Plymouth region with leaking pipes had been using 60 cubic metres - or about 450 bathtubs - of water a day.

            <p>Installing water meters has allowed the New Plymouth District Council (NPDC) to postpone a $4 million pump station upgrade for Urenui and Tikorangi in north Taranaki.</p>
        
            <p>Meters have identified so many leaks in the area - including one property using 60m3, or about 450 bathtubs a day - that once they were fixed, demand dropped to the point where the upgrade was not needed.</p>
        
            <p>Peak demand had been at 132m3 (about 880 bathtubs full) an hour - on the threshold that would have required an upgrade.</p>
        
            <p>About 13,000 meters have already been installed out of 26,000 planned across the district as part of a $248 million investment in water infrastructure across 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>So far this month, they had identified and helped stop leaks totalling 463m3 a day, equivalent to about 68 Olympic swimming pools a year.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, most households in the district paid a flat rate for water, regardless of how much they use.</p>
        
            <p>According to Water NZ's 2021 National Performance Review, residential water use of 288 litres per person per day was higher than the national average of 222 litres.</p>
