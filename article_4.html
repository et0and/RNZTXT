            <p>Coromandel's 309 Road is an old coach gravel road that winds 22km deep into the peninsula between Coromandel town and Whitianga.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, the remote road was the scene of a double shooting that left one man dead, one seriously injured, and another in custody.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands police are likely to charge a person overnight following the shooting.</p>
        
            <p>An extremely winding, curvy road, local tourism sites say it "takes you on a journey through dense bushland with lots of surprise stops to make along the road".</p>
        
            <p>According to Wikipedia, it either got its name from there being 309 bends in the road, or because horse-drawn coaches used to take 309 minutes to travel it.</p>
        
            <p>The road was reportedly developed during the Gold Rush era.</p>
        
            <p>A Coromandel travel blog calls it "a largely unpeopled landscape, bordered by river, backdropped with birdsong".</p>

            <p>On TripAdvisor, one dissatisfied traveller wrote, "Avoid that road".</p>
        
            <p>"Just too dangerous, that road can turn your beautiful holiday to a terrible memory."</p>
        
            <p>Another described it as a "drive through Jurassic Park," saying they "loved the pure adventure of this secluded drive through exotic tropical rainforest which I never knew existed."</p>
        
            <p>Among the attractions described on the road is a honey shop and an ancient kauri grove, places for swimming an picnicking, as well as Waiau Falls and the scenic Castle Rock.</p>
        
            <p>The Waiau Waterworks park features a display of water sculptures, while a large wild pig farm is another well known stop.</p>
