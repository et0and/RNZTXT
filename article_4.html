        <h2>Kiwi sets up schools to help undocumented children in Malaysia</h2>
        <p>
Children growing up undocumented in Malaysia cannot go to school, or look forward to careers or getting their drivers licence, but schools set up by a Kiwi woman are helping.

            <p>"Education is so important for every single child," says a New Zealand woman who calls Malaysia home.</p>
        
            <p>"No exceptions."</p>
        
            <p>For the last 15 years, Dr Kathryn Rivai has been on a mission to ensure all children in Malaysia can access basic education.</p>
        
            <p>Because in Malaysia, there are exceptions.</p>
        
            <p>"Our government only supports Malaysian ethnicity or Malaysian children that have documents," said Rivai, who lives in Kota Kinabalu, East Malaysia.</p>
        
            <p>Those who are undocumented or stateless are not allowed to attend school.</p>
        
            <p>"It's different from other countries like New Zealand," Rivai said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you live in New Zealand, you have to go to school. But not here."</p>
        
            <p>Under international law, a stateless person is someone who does not have citizenship in any country.</p>
        
            <p>Rivai has set up 14 "schools", called Etania Schools in Sabah state for these children, ranging from ages 5 to 18. About 1000 attend each year</p>
        
            <p>But there were likely hundreds of thousands of stateless children in the whole of Malaysia, she said.</p>
        
            <p>As they are undocumented, there are no official numbers. But Rivai said there could be up to one million stateless people just in Sabah.</p>
        
            <p>They're little kids who would otherwise be out on the humid streets, selling cigarettes or candy, she said.</p>

            <p>Those in Sabah were originally from neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
        
            <p>Civil War in the Philippines sent a rush of people to Sabah seeking safety in the 1970s and 80s. Most of those from Indonesia came in the hope of jobs and better pay.</p>
        
            <p>But as illegal migrants, they were undocumented in Malaysia. Because of this, they and their children who lack birth certificates could quickly become stateless.</p>
        
            <p>Without any rights to work or attend school, they are forced to live under the radar.</p>
        
            <p>"Their life is very tough, and people often point the finger at them as being troublemakers in society," Rivai said.</p>
        
            <p></p>
        
            <p>Her schools are a collaborative effort, but it had not always been this way.</p>
        
            <p>When Rivai started this work in 2009, there were only a few schools for undocumented children in Sabah.</p>
        
            <p>"I decided that we had to provide schools for the children. I didn't ask anyone. I just did it," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"But fortunately, because no one knew about us, no one bothered us."</p>

            <p>She eventually applied for a Registry of Societies certification, in an attempt to make the schools more official.</p>
        
            <p>However, her schools had still not been legally recognised under the Malaysian education system. Rivai said that as the children were undocumented they could also still be arrested at any time.</p>
        
            <p>There are now many NGOs involved in the education effort, with a coalition of groups in Sabah offering teacher training.</p>
        
            <p>"All of these things were non-existent in 2009. I had no one to talk to about the pitfalls," Rivai said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was learning the hard way."</p>
        
            <p>Rivai was decorated with the prestigious Malaysian Merdeka Award earlier this year for her work with Etania schools.</p>

            <p>Growing up in a kampung (village), Etania teacher Norsiya Amil said there were many undocumented people in their community. She remembered at age 12 asking her dad why they did not go to school.</p>
        
            <p>"I also wanted to stay at home and play games all day long," she said. "But my father explained that they don't have the opportunity to go to school."</p>
        
            <p>She started inviting some of the local children to their home and teaching them numbers and the alphabet. However, the school was eventually shut down.</p>
        
            <p>"The education department in some areas is not too supportive. That's using a nice word," said Rivai.</p>
        
            <p>Amil said the job was not easy.</p>
        
            <p>"But I keep reminding myself why I started, because these children are precious. They need someone to be with them, to love them, to care for them," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"If I stop now, what will happen to them in the future?"</p>
        
            <p>Even today, there is no policy from the Malaysian education department guiding the schools.</p>
        
            <p>"We all meet together and do what's best for the children in our area," Amil said.</p>

            <p>They set their own curriculum, taking "bits and pieces" of whatever is beneficial to the children.</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to make this child feel they're a part of society. That they're worthy of having a job and worthy of supporting their family," Rivai said.</p>
        
            <p>"Because after they leave school they're very well-behaved citizens. They care about their society."</p>
        
            <p>Rivai said the biggest challenge was stigmatisation by the public.</p>
        
            <p>"I really hate it when people talk about our kids negatively, and they use terrible words to describe them," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They regard them as the dregs of society."</p>

            <p>But the public's perception toward these families was difficult to change.</p>
        
            <p>"And right up to the very top, the politicians, chairmans of organisations, highly respected people in society treat our children like dirt," Rivai said.</p>
        
            <p>It was incredible that anyone could call bright-eyed, curious children 'dirt', she said. The children were "really good in school, because they have nowhere else to go".</p>
        
            <p>They get to play and learn, and importantly build self-respect and dignity, "because they don't get that in public," Rivai said.</p>
        
            <p>"No one respects them."</p>
        
            <p>Once they finish school, however, their future opportunities remained limited.</p>
        
            <p>Without documents, they could not attend university.</p>
        
            <p>"So it comes back to us and the coalition to try and do something."</p>
        
            <p>There was always the question: "What do we do with the kids when they graduate?"</p>
        
            <p>Some were trained to be teachers, staying at the schools that taught them. But most children's dreams were curbed by laws and society.</p>
        
            <p>"If a child comes and says to me 'I want to become a taxi driver', I have to tell them it's impossible because they can never get a license. They can't open bank accounts.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want to put down their dreams, but at this time in history, it's not reality.</p>
        
            <p>"I tell them: whatever you choose, you will be the very best in that field. But I know in my heart that's not telling the truth. Because that child has to know that they have to choose a career that they can achieve."</p>
        
            <p>

            <p>Etania's next project is aimed at starting a skills centre, teaching the older students skills that could lead to jobs they could do "under the radar", like setting up a sewing business or working with fixing electronics or baking.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the first step," Rivai said.</p>
        
            <p>"And then who knows, in 10 years, we will start a university ourselves. That's a definite."</p>
        
            <p>Local university students already often visit the schools to help out.</p>
        
            <p>"I see a huge potential in the university students we meet. Like a glow for humanity," said Rivai.</p>
        
            <p>"They have this sense of 'we are one' and we must help each other."</p>
        
            <p>They would become the country's leaders in the future, said Rivai, and then things would change at the top.</p>
        
            <p>"I know they will, because you can't exist like this. It's inhuman."</p>
        
            <p>RNZ contacted the High Commission of Malaysia for comment, but is yet to get a response on this story.</p>
