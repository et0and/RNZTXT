            <p>The unexplained death of a man in the Auckland suburb of Ellerslie overnight is being treated as a homicide.</p>
        
            <p>However, that will not be confirmed until after the post-mortem is complete, police say. It is being treated as a homicide due to the circumstances found at the scene, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the property on Celtic Crescent around 8pm yesterday, following a report of a man found unresponsive.</p>
        
            <p>The 66-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Police are now appealing for sightings of his wife, 67-year-old woman, Mei Han Chong, who is "missing from the address". They are also seeking information or sightings of a blue Kia Rio, registration NJN927, which was last seen at the Celtic Crescent address on Saturday after 11pm.</p>

            <p>Police believed Mei Han Chong was last at the property over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Scott Beard told Checkpoint the car was driven by the deceased man from the North Shore just after 11pm Saturday 4 October. He could not say if his wife was in the car too.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage in the investigation, that is the last time we have seen the deceased alive."</p>
        
            <p>Police do not know when it was last seen driving away.</p>
        
            <p>A relative contacted police after they saw the deceased at the property on Monday night, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage, we haven't found any weapons, but it is very early in the scene examination. And the injuries, as I say, we don't know the cause of death, and that's what the postmortem tomorrow should help us determine."</p>
        
            <p>During a press briefing, Beard said "at present there is a scene examination taking place at Ellerslie and we expect that to last for two to three days. A post-mortem examination will be conducted tomorrow".</p>
        
            <p>Police were working with and supporting the family, Beard said.</p>
        
            <p>The family were concerned because they did not know where Chong was, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Beard said police had made inquiries to see if Chong has left New Zealand but at this stage that did not appear to be the case.</p>

            <p>"We don't know and it's very early in the investigation."</p>
        
            <p>Asked if she was considered dangerous, he said: "If the public see Mei, please contact the police and let us deal with locating her".</p>
        
            <p>The man's body was found by a family member at a home owned by the family, Beard said. Just the couple lived at the house.</p>
        
            <p>Until a scene examination was completed, police would not know what had happened or how to assess it, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Part of our ongoing investigation is doing an area canvas and so we're knocking on doors of people close by to see if they can assist.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to go where the evidence takes us."</p>
        
            <p>Profiling family members was also part of the investigation, Beard said.</p>
        
            <p>Police were not looking for anyone else at this stage, but were keeping an "open mind" as the investigation continues.</p>
