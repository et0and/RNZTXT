            <p>An Air New Zealand flight had to be cancelled on Saturday morning after a bird strike.</p>
        
            <p>Flight NZ5719 from Christchurch experienced the bird strike upon landing in Invercargill, Air New Zealand chief operating officer Alex Marren said.</p>
        
            <p>The aircraft was looked over after the incident by the airline's engineering team before it returned to service.</p>
        
            <p>Flight NZ5702 from Invercargill to Christchurch was subsequently cancelled.</p>
        
            <p>Marren said Air New Zealand wanted to thank customers for their patience while it worked through the disruption.</p>
        
            <p>In New Zealand, the bird strike rate at airports is about four in 10,000 aircraft movements, according to the New Zealand Aviation Wildlife Hazard Group.</p>
        
            <p>About 90 percent of cases occur at low altitudes at airports, during take-off or landing, according to the group.</p>
        
            <p>Worldwide, bird strikes cause more than $1.2 billion in aircraft damage annually.</p>
