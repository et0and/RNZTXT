            <p>Legislation giving family violence survivors the power to quickly dissolve abusive marriages is expected to pass with unanimous support today.</p>
        
            <p>The bill - nicknamed "Ashley's law" - will allow survivors to apply for a court order dissolving a marital arrangement as soon as they get a final protection order.</p>
        
            <p>The current system requires parties to live apart for two years before making an application.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington woman Ashley Jones petitioned her local MP for Hutt South Chris Bishop to make the law change after leaving an abusive marriage in 2020.</p>
        
            <p>She said survivors had to bear a "mental and emotional" toll waiting for two years and the delay also put them at risk of ongoing abuse.</p>
        
            <p>"You've made a really hard decision to walk away from something and you can't break ties because you need to then go through a legal process in two years time.</p>
        
            <p>"I was getting punished for being brave and trying to recreate a new life and I never felt like I could truly just move on with my life because that was always hanging over me."</p>
        
            <p>Jones said the day felt exciting - but also bittersweet, as she'd spent four years of her life advocating for the law change.</p>
        
            <p>"Going into this I very quickly learned that politics isn't fast and it wouldn't make a difference for me but I knew that if I could make a difference for anyone that came after me, then that was going to be amazing.</p>
        
            <p>"Advocating for others so they don't have to experience what I experience gives me a lot of peace; knowing that I didn't go through everything for nothing."</p>
        
            <p>Labour MP Deborah Russell was shepherding the legislation through its final reading today. The bill was originally introduced by her former colleague Angie Warren-Clark.</p>
        
            <p>"This particular change is really important because of the way that abusers can continue to abuse their ex-partner because they are tied to them legally," Russell said.</p>
        
            <p>"So it's good to give people an opportunity to get away from a relationship in which they have suffered abuse."</p>
        
            <p>Bishop said he was looking forward to seeing the legislation pass with support from all MPs today.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a classic example of a member of the public identifying an issue, bringing it to parliament's attention by way of a petition, a lot of people figuring out that something needed to be done and parliament going through the process of doing that."</p>
        
            <p>He acknowledged Jones' advocacy and said while it had taken several years to get to this point, it was still progress.</p>
        
            <p>"It's taken a bit longer than Ashley would have liked I'm sure and probably longer than we all would have liked but it's a members bill, it's not a government bill... good things take time sometimes."</p>
        
            <p>Russell said those who had advocated for change did not want others to deal with what they had too.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had a number of people contact me about the bill and talk about their own circumstances and they've said it's a shame that they won't be able to use it themselves... but they've all said we want to make sure that no one has to go through this again."</p>
        
            <p>The Family Proceedings (Dissolution for Family Violence) Amendment Bill will be read a third and final time later today.</p>
