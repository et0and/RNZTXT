            <p>State Highway 29 over the Kaimai Range has been blocked after a three-vehicle crash, and a crash near Kaikohe has blocked State Highway 12 in Northland.</p>
        
            <p>Police said emergency services were working at the scene of a crash on the lower Kaimais, between a car, ute and small truck that happened about 10:30am on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>There were not thought to be any serious injuries, but a section of State Highway 29 had been closed, and there was a heavy build-up of traffic as a result.</p>
        
            <p>The crash was between Poripori Road and Thorn Road, and would take some time to clear, police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Drivers - especially those leaving Tauranga - were warned to expect long delays.</p>
        
            <p>In Northland, a truck had rolled just after 11am on Friday, on State Highway 12 at Taheke, south west of Kaikohe.</p>
        
            <p>Police said no one was injured in the crash, but the highway closed as the truck was blocking the road.</p>
        
            <p>"Motorists are asked to avoid the area and seek alternative routes, the road is expected to be blocked for an extended period of time."</p>
