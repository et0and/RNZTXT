            <p>A Wellington commuter says she and other passengers felt like they almost passed out because of crowding on a train.</p>
        
            <p>More train services were cancelled and delayed in the capital on Thursday as rail staff continued their industrial action ahead of contract talks.</p>
        
            <p>This industrial action was launched after seven bargaining meetings since work for a new collective agreement started in July.</p>
        
            <p>Since Tuesday they have been 'working to rule' - taking all breaks and not working overtime or accepting alterations to their shifts.</p>
        
            <p>Tatiana said her trip from Manor Park this morning was awful.</p>
        
            <p>"I almost just passed out on a train this morning, and I was waiting half an hour for a train."</p>
        
            <p>The train stopped for about seven minutes on its approach to the station, she said.</p>
        
            <p>A commuter at Wellington Railway Station, Colin Blake, said he was sick of the delays.</p>
        
            <p>His train last night was 40 minutes late, and there were no signs indicating delays or cancellations, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile another Wellington commuter, Tom, said he supported industrial action by train staff, despite the disruption it's caused.</p>
        
            <p>Metlink warned Wellington commuters about limited bus replacements due to industrial action by train staff ahead of pay talks.</p>
        
            <p>It said it was aware that last night, some commuters were stranded in Wellington city, and had to pay to stay in a hotel overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Transdev and the Rail and Maritime Transport Union will commence pay talks tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>Transdev managing director Ian Ladd told RNZ it was very optimistic the dispute can be resolved at a meeting on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>"I think both parties want this to conclude in a positive manner."</p>
        
            <p>Ladd said a mediation meeting had also been scheduled for Monday as a "back up".</p>
        
            <p>"We like to plan ahead accordingly, we hope in good faith bargaining that will be achieved [a solution] tomorrow."</p>
        
            <p>He said delays and cancellations on the services were due to when rostering was scheduled alongside any issues on the train network.</p>
        
            <p>Ladd said the problems experienced this week were not due to them not having enough staff.</p>
        
            <p>He said the transport operator was disappointed about the delays this week.</p>
        
            <p>"We are aware of the delays due to the industrial action, and we are trying to work as best as we can to avoid any delays."</p>
        
            <p>The action is currently expected to continue until at least Monday.</p>
