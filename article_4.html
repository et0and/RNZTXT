            <p>The police are continuing to investigate after a person was shot in the leg in Kowhai Park in Feilding last weekend.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands it was the result of an online marketplace sale gone wrong.</p>
        
            <p>The person was hospitalised.</p>
        
            <p>The police said Friday that their inquiries continue.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Herald is reporting the sale involved a $2000 pair of shoes, and according to a friend of the victim, two men travelled to the park to meet a seller they had connected with online.</p>
        
            <p>When they arrived, three people in masks confronted the pair, demanded money, and reportedly shot the victim when they refused, fleeing with mobile phones and other belongings.</p>
