            <p>The company behind a mine labelled "the most significant single gold discovery in New Zealand in four decades" believes revenue of $NZ4.4 billion could be made in the lifespan of the mine.</p>
        
            <p>Santana Minerals released a scoping study to the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday revealing key financial data and other metrics for its gold mine project at the Rise and Shine prospect near Bendigo and Tarras.</p>
        
            <p>Based on the current spot gold price of $3900 per ounce, the mine's revenue would be $4.4b.</p>
        
            <p>It expected to make a net profit after tax of $2b. Total production costs would be about $1.6b.</p>
        
            <p>The Australian-owned company estimated it needed six months to get through the permitting phase and a year to begin construction.</p>
        
            <p>The mine would operate for eight years as an open-cast mine and for four years underground, recovering 1.12 million ounces of gold, the company said.</p>
        
            <p>The Rise and Shine Strike is the most promising of four strikes within 5km of each other.</p>
        
            <p>Drilling results have revealed thick, continuous, high-grade intercepts, traced 1.7km down-plunge.</p>
        
            <p>The scoping study also listed the local infrastructure advantages.</p>
        
            <p>There would be no fly-in, fly-out of staff or major camps required, it said. Nearby Cromwell had an 8000-strong labour pool and there was main road access from State Highway 8.</p>
        
            <p>Queenstown International Airport was just a one-hour drive away, Lake Dunstan provided access to fresh water and the Clyde Dam supplied clean, green energy.</p>
        
            <p>Indicative metallurgy showed free milling gold, recoverable by gravity followed by cyanide leach. These methods together were expected to achieve 91 percent to 94 percent recovery of the gold resource.</p>
        
            <p>The report said there was "plenty more" to be discovered at the site.</p>
        
            <p>The report showed three of six steps in Santana's study stream into the commercialisation of the resource had been completed.</p>
        
            <p>There was "a clear case" to move straight into pre-feasibility studies, the report said.</p>
        
            <p>Two more steps would then follow - mine development and stakeholder engagement submissions and definitive feasibility studies, the scoping report said.</p>
        
            <p>Santana's study stream 2 related to more intensive exploration of the strike, including more drilling, mapping and geochemistry work.</p>
        
            <p>It is not yet clear whether Santana would be able to apply for resource consent under the government's Fast-Track Approvals Bill, for which public submissions close tomorrow.</p>
