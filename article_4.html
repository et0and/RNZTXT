        <h2>3D printer aims to save endangered indigenous fish</h2>
        <p>
NIWA has developed a Photarium with 3D printing to more safely identify and measure fish species in the waterways.

            <p>NIWA is using a 3D printer to help save New Zealand's endangered native fish.</p>
        
            <p>The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research has developed a Photarium with 3D printing to more safely identify and measure fish species in the waterways.</p>
        
            <p>A Photarium is a small plastic rectangular box, with a clear side and built-in ruler, that allows small fish to be studied without being handled or taken out of water.</p>
        
            <p>They currently are only made in the United States and do not ship to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>With NIWA acquiring a new 3D printer, NIWA freshwater ecologist Peter Williams decided to develop his own.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said he designed NIWA's Photarium based on the fish species in New Zealand's waterways.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of our native species are climbing fish and the top part of the lid can be closed to stop the fish from jumping out. A mesh that's printed into this hatch cover allows us to top up the water level for better photography."</p>
        
            <p>NIWA said Photarium would improve the accuracy of fish identification without harming the fish.</p>
        
            <p>It is already had over 70 orders for its Photarium from regional councils, rÅ«nanga, DOC, and education groups across the country.</p>
