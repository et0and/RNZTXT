            <p>New Zealand's largest operator of low-cost GPs - Tamaki Health - says at least five of its walk-in clinics in Auckland have had patients queuing ahead of opening hours.</p>
        
            <p>It was reported earlier this week that dozens of patients were queuing for hours outside Local Doctors Otara, as early as 6.30am.</p>
        
            <p>Local Doctors Otara is one of 13 walk-in clinics run by Tamaki Health in Auckland, where patients can be seen on the day without an appointment. It is part of the Very Low Cost Access (VLCA) scheme - which subsidised GP appointments in communities with the greatest healthcare needs, with visits costing $19.50.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaki Health operates a total of 38 clinics in Auckland, most of which are part of the VLCA scheme.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Lloyd McCann said he was aware of morning queues ahead of opening hours at their Takanini, MƒÅngere Town Centre, Mount Roskill and Glenn Innes clinics - all walk-in clinics.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen significant worsening of these queues over the winter this year. As health needs increase and the cost of living challenges have ramped up, it has got to this point," he said.</p>
        
            <p>McCann said the core problem was long-standing underinvestment in primary health care and the struggle to access care.</p>
        
            <p>He said they were trying their best to improve the interim situation.</p>
        
            <p>"We're not sitting on our hands around this queuing problem, we are working to increase access, so obviously constantly out for recruitment," he said.</p>
        
            <p>McCann said many people presenting at the clinic were struggling with the cost of living crisis. He said there were people in poor housing, people who were unemployed, beneficiaries and people with acute health needs over the winter months.</p>
        
            <p>Fifty-five-year-old Jason Radics said he had to wait for more than four hours at the Local Doctors Glen Innes just to renew a prescription for heart medication.</p>
        
            <p>"Exactly the same as Otara, people queuing up early in the morning, out in the cold and then when you get in there could be a four or five hour wait. If someone arrives at, say, 11 o'clock in the morning, they're usually told: 'we're not seeing any more patients, go to another clinic'," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Radics said there was a queue of up to 20 sick people outside the clinic every morning, as early as 7am.</p>
        
            <p>"There's all sorts of people, people coughing and spluttering, and all kinds of sicknesses, definitely older people, people that are there on walking support, some people have to wait in their car and get someone else to hold their place in line because they can't stand full on...you feel pretty bad for those people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Radics said he had observed that there was usually just one or two doctors at the clinic.</p>
        
            <p>McCann said there were three to four doctors at the Glenn Innes clinic, but in some instances, staff sickness and last minute challenges left the clinic with one or two doctors.</p>
