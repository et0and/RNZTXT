            <p>Auckland's maunga authority is considering closing mountains to the public on holidays due to 'unlawful' fires.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after two weekend blazes on Māngere mountain, with one scorching three hectares.</p>
        
            <p>The fires are being investigated by police and Fire and Emergency, but Tupuna Maunga Authority chairperson Paul Majurey believed the fires were intentional.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to Morning Report, Majurey said there had been some "very sick behaviours" on Auckland's mountains and it was hard to fathom why people would do it.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a few individuals who are being reckless on these sacred spaces."</p>
        
            <p>Fires on the mountains was very distressing for local iwi, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The authority could undertake a certain amount of management responsibility but Majurey said enforcement would need to be done by police and Fire and Emergency New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We have limited options to protect these taonga - but a last resort is closing down the maunga."</p>
        
            <p>There were no proposals as such, he said, but the authority was looking at options.</p>
        
            <p>"We have wide support from the community to do that as people understand what we're faced with and recognise these iconic places."</p>
