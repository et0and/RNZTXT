            <p>Hailed as a groundbreaker at its 2022 launch, the Eastbourne to Wellington electric ferry has been sitting idle for the past seven months.</p>
        
            <p>First a fault, then a delay in replacement parts, have kept the Ika Rere - the 'flying fish' - tied to the wharf.</p>
        
            <p>It has left many locals who catch the ferry disappointed.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not very good, they have had some bad luck, I feel really sorry for them," Justin Bloomfield said.</p>
        
            <p>"I would have liked to have had more information about the problems and what exactly they are and the reason for the delay," Kerry Scott said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm sad, I was very excited when it was introduced. I thought it was a great move," Graham Blackwell said.</p>
        
            <p>Ika Rere was the first electric passenger ferry in the Southern Hemisphere and its operator, East by West Ferries, said there were very few electric craft in the world that came close to its performance.</p>
        
            <p>It was launched with much excitement in March 2022, but in July 2024 a fault near the propeller stopped the vessel from making its scheduled trips across Wellington Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>It was hoped the ferry would get back to work in October, but the replacement parts were in Europe and there was a hold-up with the suppliers.</p>
        
            <p>
The fault is not related to the ferry's electric source, East by West Ferries chief executive Mat Jonsson says.

            <p>Transport Minister Chris Bishop lives close to the ferry terminal in Days Bay and said commuters were annoyed.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a bit frustrating but as I understand it, there was a bit of an issue that they're fixing, they're taking a bit longer than East by West Ferries would like.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a fantastic asset for the Wellington region ... it's such a great thing in New Zealand if we decarbonise our economy and electrify much more of our economy so it's a wonderful thing."</p>
        
            <p>This is not the first problem for the Ika Rere. In September 2022 it lost power in the middle of a sailing and a police boat had to take passengers back to shore.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not an expert in ferry design and ferry maintenance, there's been an issue with the boat, they're fixing it, it'll be back in action," Bishop said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a shame it's taken a bit longer than everyone would have liked but also it's really important we have safe boats. It is what it is."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, East by West chief executive Mat Jonsson said the ferry's fault was not related to its electric source.</p>
        
            <p>He hoped the Ika Rere would be crossing the harbour again in late March.</p>
