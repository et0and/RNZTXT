            <p>Rangers are using wolf decoys to scare Canada geese away from display gardens and popular picnic areas at the Christchurch Botanic Gardens.</p>
        
            <p>Its director Wolfgang Bopp told Morning Report that the sheer number of the birds was the problem.</p>
        
            <p>"They're large birds and for any large animal, what goes in the front, comes out in the back and that's quite a lot.</p>
        
            <p>"If we only had a couple of them, five or six across the gardens, that wouldn't be a problem."</p>
        
            <p>He wanted picnic-goers to be able to put their rug on the lawns without having to contend with a lot of geese faeces.</p>

            <p>The decoys were a black cutout of a wolf or coyote with white eyes and writing on it to identify that they were being used as predator control.</p>
        
            <p>Bopp first heard about the effectiveness of the decoys from Clearwater Golf Course, who have used them for about two to three years.</p>
        
            <p>"They actually gave us one of the decoys which we then just traced over and cut out our own ones."</p>
        
            <p>The decoys were moved every day, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"[The ranger] will move them every day and he's actually going as far as barking at the geese at the same time.</p>
        
            <p>"Now, he's finding that as soon as they see him, they think, 'Oh right, ok, let's move on'."</p>
        
            <p>While the decoys did not work 100 percent of the time, Bopp said they were seeing a real difference for the lawns where they did not want geese.</p>
