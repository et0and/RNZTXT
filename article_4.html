        <h2>Review: September 5 a 'terrific, suspenseful thriller'</h2>
        <p>
A well known story is given a different perspective in September 5, and it's edge-of-seat thrilling, writes Simon Morris. Video
</p>
        
            <p>Review - September 5 takes on, you'd think, well-covered territory - the tragic events of the Munich Olympics of 1972, when a dozen Israeli athletes and coaches were held hostage by a group of terrorists calling themselves Black September.</p>
        
            <p>But this film is more interested in how we learned that story.</p>
        
            <p>The events, and their aftermath, were the basis of Steven Spielberg's 2005 thriller Munich.</p>
        
            <p>But September 5 has a different focus. It's how the hostage drama was covered on television, live as it happened, by people who seemed to have no business doing it - ABC's sports team.</p>
        
            <p>The advantage a sports crew had over professional journalists was they were there. They had all the facilities of a major live event, including multiple crews covering various sports events from all angles.</p>
        
            <p>Now they had to pivot from sports drama to the real thing. And as far as head of ABC sports Roone Arledge was concerned, there was no difference.</p>
        
            <p>As played - brilliantly - by Peter Sarsgaard, Arledge sees his job as simply following the story, minute-by-minute, wherever it may lead.</p>
        
            <p>And all the pressure is suddenly on one of the most junior people in the control room, the overnight director Jeff Mason, played by John Magaro.</p>
        
            <p>The overnight crew is very much the B Team. Their job is keeping the seat warm until daytime and the big important sports events.</p>
        
            <p>But when shots are clearly heard, all that changes. Jeff and his boss Marvin Bader - Ben Chaplin as the conscience of the film - find themselves on a war footing.</p>
        
            <p>World-wide television coverage was still in its infancy. The Moon landing - the first big, live, global event was a mere three years before.</p>
        
            <p>And September 5 shows just how primitive this early technology was.</p>
        
            <p>For anyone who wasn't around television in the early '70s, the then-state of the art may look like early Doctor Who. Jeff Mason had access to a mere handful of cameras, some welded to the spot.</p>
        
            <p>Much of the coverage was coming from film cameras, whose 16mm footage was rushed back to the studio to be developed on the fly, then chopped up before going on air.</p>
        
            <p>All the action of September 5 takes place in the ABC facility - the crowded control room, the small studio where front-man Jim McKay - in actual historic footage - anchors the events, the editing suite down the corridor, and so on.</p>
        
            <p>And like everyone at the time, we get our information from what shows on their screens, and what's relayed by reporters on the ground - American and German.</p>

            <p>Which is where the fourth major character is all-important - one of the few Germans in the control room, journalist and translator Marianne, played by Leonie Benesch.</p>
        
            <p>Not only is she one of the few people who can tell what's going on, but she's all too aware of the historical significance.</p>
        
            <p>The West German authorities were extremely anxious to eradicate the memory of the previous Munich Olympics - Hitler's Fascist, 1936 version.</p>
        
            <p>Which was why, fatally, the West German army was forbidden to go anywhere near the Olympic Village, and the job of dealing with the terrorists was left to the hopelessly under-prepared local police.</p>
        
            <p>The German point of view of writer Moritz Binder and director Tim Fehlbaum gives September 5 an unexpected perspective. And so does the realisation that we're watching the birth of something all too familiar.</p>
        
            <p>Round the clock, 24-hour-a-day news coverage was born this day.</p>
        
            <p>But above all, September 5 is just a terrific, suspenseful thriller. These are people doing the best they can to bring an important story to the world, and wrestling with the moral dilemmas involved for the first time.</p>
