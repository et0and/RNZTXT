        <h2>Learnings for councils as residents want greater say</h2>
        <p>
Almost 70 percent of people want to be more involved in council decisions, but reaching the community to enable engagement can be a challenge.

            <p>A yawning gap continues to exist between a belief that locals should get involved with their council and the numbers of people that actually do.</p>
        
            <p>Poll data released by Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ) on Thursday shows almost 70 percent of people believe communities should be more involved when council decisions are made.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, just over half of residents think more decisions need to be delegated to communities by councils.</p>
        
            <p>"Control should be faced as near the people as possible," said LGNZ chief executive Susan Freeman-Greene.</p>
        
            <p>"Communities believe that councils are more effective if they do localism, because localism ensures communities get the right solutions for their specific needs."</p>
        
            <p>But getting people involved in local government process is a challenge across the country, even in voting where turnout nationwide for local elections was just 40 percent in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>Looking at Tasman, its walking and cycling strategy - which detailed changes for many of the district's major urban roads - received just 238 submissions despite a population of almost 60,000.</p>
        
            <p>That lack of engagement has caused headaches for the council when there was vocal opposition to the cycleways once they were installed in the district's most populous town.</p>
        
            <p>"Richmond has always been hard to get people engaged," said Kit Maling, one of the town's ward councillors.</p>
        
            <p>Despite limited input on the strategy itself and the subsequent backlash, the council saw higher levels of engagement when residents were given the option to have a direct say.</p>

            <p>The new road layouts had input from community working groups that voted on different options.</p>
        
            <p>Maling, who attended several of the sessions, said that people showed up.</p>
        
            <p>"We had good turnout. We could get 20-25 people at those meetings. People were interested in it, I wouldn't say it was always unanimous, but the people were interested."</p>
        
            <p>But the system's not quite refined yet. The final plan for Wensley Road, which saw five speed humps installed, wasn't shown to working group members.</p>
        
            <p>Community pushback on that layout eventually caused Maling to successfully push for the removal of two humps.</p>
        
            <p>
Despite success in getting people engaged, the council still has to iron out its processes after it approved an unpopular road design that wasn't supported by residents.

            <p>Engagement appears to vary based on topic - "peoples' eyes just glaze over" when it comes to long-term plans, Maling said - but providing the opportunity can make all the difference.</p>
        
            <p>Open workshops in Māpua about the town's upcoming structure plan, in which residents can have direct input into discussions with council staff, can have 60-70 people attend.</p>
        
            <p>"It works really well," Maling said.</p>
        
            <p>Finding better ways to get residents involved in council matters saw the launch of the People's Panel Te Kōrari in Canterbury in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The project was showcased to council representatives on Thursday by LGNZ as an example of a way to further engagement with communities.</p>
        
            <p>Residents can sign up to be part of the panel and are then occasionally sent short surveys about work that Environment Canterbury is planning to undertake.</p>
        
            <p>"It provides a bit of a 'sense check' to help us get a feel for community sentiment around particular issues," said deputy chair Craig Pauling.</p>
        
            <p>The results from those surveys then inform the council's decisions ahead of undertaking more formal consultation.</p>
        
            <p>"Local knowledge is really important," Pauling said.</p>
        
            <p>"Their feedback can ultimately help shape decisions we make, which can directly impact their community."</p>
