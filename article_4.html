        <h2>Backtrack on median barrier installation after residents complain</h2>
        <p>
Locals banded together to fight the installation of the barrier, saying it would block escape in an emergency and slow first responders.

            <p>Those against a median barrier blocking direct access to their homes have won a small victory after the New Zealand Transport Agency decided not to install the rest of the barrier.</p>
        
            <p>However, Waka Kotahi said it would not remove the section of barrier already installed on State Highway 2 at Aongatete in the Western Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>Despite that, Kirsten Warbrooke said she was over the moon at the outcome, after years of lobbying against the barrier, which was partly installed in July.</p>
        
            <p>"It's more than we asked for," she said. "I'm in shock to be honest."</p>
        
            <p>The residents banded together to fight the installation of the barrier which they said had caused much more dangerous driving because it blocked direct access to their homes and businesses on side roads that intersect with SH2.</p>
        
            <p>Their lobbying, together with a protest and vocal criticism of the barrier, which they also said blocked escape in the event of a tsunami and would slow emergency responders, prompted NZTA to conduct a review of the safety improvements.</p>
        
            <p>Those included road widening, a reduction in speed to 80km/h and side barriers, plus the partly completed median barrier installation, introduced on the stretch of highway between Ōmokoroa and Waihī since 2019.</p>
        
            <p>NZTA chief executive Nicole Rosie said in a statement on Friday the board had confirmed further median barrier work would no longer proceed on the remaining two sections of SH2, following a review of the scope of the safety improvements project.</p>
        
            <p>"The NZTA board has decided the best way forward for the safety improvement project is to complete the two further roundabouts and wide centrelines, maintaining all right-turning movements on remaining intersections along the corridor, but not to continue with the remainder of the median barrier installation."</p>
        
            <p>The board recommended the speed limit remain at 80km/h.</p>
        
            <p>Rosie said the decision addressed the concerns by residents about travel impacts and turning access and recognised the unique circumstances of the section of SH2.</p>
        
            <p>"Specifically that local roads connect to the state highway with no alternate routes and significant distances before turning opportunities."</p>
        
            <p>She said 15,000 vehicles travelled the section of state highway every day, and this would continue to grow.</p>
        
            <p>"A large proportion of the daily traffic movements is associated with the many local businesses in the area and local residents going about their daily lives.</p>
        
            <p>"The many competing demands on this section of state highway need to be balanced to ensure this critical corridor remains safe and efficient."</p>
        
            <p>NZTA estimated that when completed the project would deliver a 44 percent reduction in deaths and serious injuries.</p>
        
            <p>The agency said between 2009 and 2018 there were 25 fatal and 66 serious injury crashes on the road but resident Mike Williams pointed out there had been a drop since then and after the road safety improvements began.</p>
        
            <p>He said the initial improvements never had a chance to be measured before the median barrier was installed.</p>
        
            <p>Williams, who lives on Wright Road, one of the busiest side roads with orchards on it, said he was pleased with the outcome to a point.</p>
        
            <p>"It depends on what the outcome will be for Wright Road, Dawson and Aongatete roads which are currently still blocked."</p>
        
            <p>Warbrooke said initially, several years ago, the residents had asked for a right-turn into Work Road and said that the second stage of the barrier would now not be installed was a great result.</p>
        
            <p>However, she said there was still a way to go.</p>
        
            <p>"Wright Road will still have to keep up the good fight."</p>
        
            <p>Rosie said the board's decision reflected priorities in the Government Policy Statement for land transport 2024 (GPS) which was to support economic growth, through efficient investment in the land transport system to quickly and safely connect people and freight.</p>
        
            <p>She said NZTA would now work through the detail, including cost and timeframes of what this meant for the project and when the changes would be implemented.</p>
        
            <p>"We are aware there are a range of views in the community about this issue and that not everyone will be satisfied with the board's decision, but we ask everyone to show respect for our front-line team as they complete this project."</p>
        
            <p>She said the board determined this approach "appropriately balances travel impacts for local journeys and safety for all road users".</p>
