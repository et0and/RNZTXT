Water testing is carried out in Canterbury from November to March, at beaches, lakes and rivers, to test for faecal contamination, and toxic algae.

            <p>Recreational use can safely resume at Lake Rua, north of Christchurch, and in a stretch of the North Canterbury Waiau-Uwha River, after health warnings for the two Canterbury waterways have been lifted, Te Whatu Ora says.</p>
        
            <p>Faecal bacteria levels have fallen at Lake Rua, in Roto Kohatu Reserve, north of Christchurch, Medical Officer of Health Dr Cheryl Brunton said. So they and are now within the acceptable guidelines, and the lake is safe for recreational use.</p>
        
            <p>"This is great news for swimmers and other recreational water users ... who would have been avoiding the water following the recent high levels of contamination," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Water contaminated by human or animal faecal bacteria could contain a range of disease-causing micro-organisms, such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa.</p>
        
            <p>"In most cases the ill-health effects from exposure to contaminated water are minor and short-lived. However, there is the potential for more serious diseases, such as hepatitis A, giardia, cryptosporidiosis, campylobacter and salmonella," Dr Brunton said.</p>
        
            <p>Recent water testing at the south bank tributary of the Waiau-Uwha River, above the Waiau Bridge in north Canterbury, had also shown the quantity of potentially toxic algae in the river had reduced.</p>
        
            <p>Concentrations there were now below the level that was a concern to public health, Dr Brunton said.</p>
        
            <p>Testing would continue on a monthly basis, she said, and the public would be informed if the water became unsafe again.</p>
        
            <p>And people can check where it is safe to swim, on the Land Air Water website.</p>
