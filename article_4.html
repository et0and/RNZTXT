            <p>Bay of Plenty police are warning drivers not to get behind the wheel drunk, after a rise in the number of impaired motorists being caught.</p>
        
            <p>The region's road policing manager, Inspector Logan Marsh, said 10 people who were stopped by police at a checkpoint had alcohol levels four times over the limit last week.</p>
        
            <p>As well as facing prosecution, two of the 10 drivers had their vehicles immediately impounded while another three had their licences suspended immediately, because their reading was over 650, Marsh said.</p>
        
            <p>Intoxicated drivers were being caught all hours, some with "ridiculous levels", he said.</p>
        
            <p>The legal alcohol limit for a fully licensed driver over 20 is 250mcg per litre of breath, and the limit for those under 20 is zero.</p>
        
            <p>"These people are sharing the roads with our family, our friends, and our colleagues," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The actions of drivers who get behind the wheel when they're impaired puts all road users at risk - and our staff see the devastating consequences on a far too frequent basis."</p>

            <p>Marsh said driving after drinking alcohol puts others at risk and with Christmas festivities starting, attitudes needed to change.</p>
        
            <p>Sergeant Mark Holmes said the numbers were indicative of what other recent checkpoints in the area had found.</p>
        
            <p>Two weeks ago, police caught nine people driving intoxicated during a two-hour checkpoint near ÅŒmokoroa, Holmes said.</p>
        
            <p>"Last week, we stopped several people during the day with readings far exceeding the limit, including a person with a breath alcohol level of 1100 and another with a reading of 754 at 10am.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not uncommon for us to be catching people driving impaired as early as 8am or 9am."</p>
        
            <p>The incidents were a stark reminder of the importance of breath testing, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Motorists can expect to be stopped and breath tested anywhere, at any time."</p>
