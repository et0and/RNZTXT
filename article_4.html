            <p>Fly-tipping is skyrocketing in Gisborne, with 700 tonnes of trash - including pig carcasses, syringes, fridges, and car tyres - estimated to have been dumped this financial year.</p>
        
            <p>That is up from 350 tonnes in the 2023 financial year, which was more than double the 150 tonnes dumped in the 2021 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just our beautiful beaches that have been abused with rotting carcasses, human faeces and household rubbish, it's our residential areas," Gisborne District Council's solid waste manager Phil Nickerson said.</p>
        
            <p>"This includes people's private properties, commercial areas, roadsides, and recreational areas."</p>
        
            <p>The cost to the community for disposing of illegal waste was $485 per tonne for landfill gate fees, plus collection costs, Nickerson said.</p>
        
            <p>Tai Rāwhiti's waste disposal fees were among the highest in the country because there were limited landfill options, so most rubbish was trucked out of the district, he said.</p>

Trash collected on 16 April, along with eight pig carcasses, from a small stretch of sand dunes along Centennial Marine Drive (the “Mad Mile”) in Gisborne.

</p>
        
            <p>That meant ratepayers ended up paying "exorbitant costs" to clean up other people's trash.</p>
        
            <p>"On gate fees alone this year's bill is forecast to be $339,500. This unexpected spike in fly-tipping means this year's costs will completely blow the council's annual budget of $70,000."</p>
        
            <p>Tai Rāwhiti Mayor Rehette Stoltz said it was "heartbreaking" to see the amount of rubbish that was dumped.</p>
        
            <p>"I live just outside of town and often I would drive home and there would be old mattresses or an old TV or just someone's black bags that they've dumped next to the road.</p>
        
            <p>"It's unacceptable and it's really disappointing."</p>
        
            <p>Nickerson said bags of rubbish dumped this week on the side of Stanley Road broke open, spilling about 50 needles and syringes across the footpath.</p>

            <p>"Not only is this a major concern, but it's also a serious risk to pedestrians, including children and animals walking to the beach.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a serious risk to our contractors who collect this waste for disposal."</p>
        
            <p>There had also been a significant increase in illegal dumping outside businesses and charity shops.</p>
        
            <p>Waste Management staff spent around two or three hours every morning clearing dumped rubbish from outside the transfer station's gate, he said.</p>
        
            <p>That included rubbish bags, construction and building waste, couches and mattresses, and sometimes weighed up to four tonnes.</p>

            <p>"Waste dumped outside after hours is not acceptable disposal."</p>
        
            <p>Much of the illegal dumping found contained recyclable items, like washing machines, fridges, cars, bottles and plastics, which could have been disposed of at no cost, Nickerson said.</p>
        
            <p>He thanked community members who disposed of their waste correctly, as well as those who volunteered to pick up illegal dumping, but said the latter was a short-term fix.</p>
        
            <p>"Think about the products you buy and how you can reduce the waste that's produced."</p>
        
            <p>The council was planning to increase kerbside collection services to help better separate waste.</p>
        
            <p>There were also plans for a resource recovery centre and increased education around waste, Nickerson said.</p>
        
            <p>People could report illegal dumping by using the GDC Fix App, emailing service@gdc.govt.nz or calling 0800 653 800.</p>
