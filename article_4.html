            <p>Approximately $50,000 cash, electronics and stolen trailers were also found at the properties.</p>
        
            <p>The 13, which included several patched gang members, were now appearing before the court on a range of charges, including possession of methamphetamine for supply, supplying methamphetamine and participating in an organised crime group.</p>
        
            <p>Police also seized several vehicles including a Harley Davidson, a Holden Commodore and a Ford Ranger and will allege through the courts that they were purchased with the profits from criminal activity.</p>

            <p>Detective sergeant Leonie Smith said the seizures and arrests would make a significant dent to drug offending in the city.</p>
        
            <p>"We know the harm methamphetamine does in our community and our team has worked tirelessly to gather a significant amount of evidence ahead of terminating.</p>
        
            <p>"This demonstrates the commitment to hold people to account by putting them before the courts and ensuring they are stripped of assets bought with their criminal profits," Smith said.</p>
