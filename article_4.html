        <h2>What are the hopes for the future of Aotearoa?</h2>
        <p>
From Tangata Whenua to Tangata Tiriti, from seasoned attendees to first-time visitors at Waitangi, their visions for Aotearoa share a common theme - kotahitanga.

            <p>As the sun rose over Te Whare Rūnanga, the air filled with waiata, kōrero, and the sound of paddles cutting through the moana - thousands gathered at Waitangi, each carrying their own hopes and aspirations for the future of Aotearoa.</p>

            <p>Out on the moana, Tanya Rogers stands as the kaihautū (captain) of Tī Eke Waka o Te Arawa, one of the few waka exclusively paddled by wāhine.</p>
        
            <p>Representing Ngāti Whakaue and Taranaki, she said the journey to Waitangi was hard work, but ultimately rewarding.</p>
        
            <p>"We practiced all through winter, through dry-land paddles. For most of us, this was our first time paddling here, and it was absolutely magical,"</p>
        
            <p>But she said their mission extends beyond the water.</p>
        
            <p>"Our job is to bring our rangatahi up. We hope we've been an inspiration to them so they can reach their aspirations of being wāhine toa."</p>
        
            <p>
Rogers hope rangatahi watching the waka celebrations today were inspired to be 'mana wāhine', 'wāhine toa'.

            <p>What she hopes for the future of Aotearoa she said, is kotahitanga.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to see more unity, more coming together, to see our Māori people standing together, being strong and taking us into the future. And again, our rangatahi are doing that."</p>
        
            <p>Kataraina WiHongi, attending Waitangi with her mokopuna, envisions a future grounded in peace and justice.</p>
        
            <p>"If we aim for justice and peace for our tamariki and mokopuna, with their whakapapa and whakaaro, i raro i te humārie - the humbleness and the peace - then kia tau te rangimārie i roto i ngā mea katoa,"</p>
        
            <p>While watching the waka celebrations with her mokopuna, she reflected on how much the space has changed.</p>

            <p>"When I was a little girl, I just swam here, because it was a Pākehā space. But now, it is very Māori. Our tamariki are growing up with te reo in kōhanga, in kura kaupapa and we need to embrace that."</p>
        
            <p>Pat Gray, Agnes Hermans, Ange Jones and Margo Irvine are representatives of Whangārei Network Waitangi, an organisation they said has spent decades educating Pākehā on Treaty issues.</p>
        
            <p>Their focus now is on constitutional transformation, guided by Matike Mai, a report envisioning a future where tino rangatiratanga is honoured.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe that an Aotearoa that upholds Te Tiriti benefits all New Zealanders," Hermans said.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>"A constitution based on Matike Mai would create a future for all of us."</p>
        
            <p>Jones added, "For us, tino rangatiratanga, honouring te tiriti is good for all New Zealand. Te ao Māori, the values, the values system care for the environment etcetera, this is what makes Aotearoa great."</p>
        
            <p>While being at Waitangi, kitted out in their 'Tangata Tiriti' kākahu, Hermans said they have received "lots of aroha and lots of support."</p>
        
            <p>"Particularly from tangata whenua, saying 'kia ora thank you for showing up' 'we really appreciate you being here."</p>
        
            <p>But they also received a lot of nods and smiles from Pākehā too, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think we are being a witness to something that is bigger than just the few of us, there is real base support."</p>
        
            <p>For Margo Irvine, attending Waitangi is an experience every New Zealander should have at least once.</p>
        
            <p>"I wish that all New Zealanders could experience the atmosphere here - the passion, the fun, the colour, the kotahitanga. It is a very special thing."</p>

            <p>For one first-time visitor from Tāmaki Makaurau, Waitangi was an unforgettable experience.</p>
        
            <p>"Waitangi is absolutely wonderful, it's inclusive, it's welcoming, I understand now why its so popular for Tangata Whenua and Pākehā like myself... Lifes an adventure and this is part of it."</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead, she hoped for "a more cohesive society, one that respects tangata whenua."</p>
