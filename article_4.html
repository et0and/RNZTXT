            <p>A British passenger aboard a plane that caught fire after leaving Queenstown Monday night has described feeling a big bang moments after takeoff.</p>
        
            <p>A Virgin Australia flight headed for Melbourne carrying 67 passengers was diverted to Invercargill after flames were seen coming from the back of the Boeing 737.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers were being bussed back to Queenstown Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>The airline said the emergency was the result of a possible bird strike but the 737's engine needed to be inspected by engineers.</p>
        
            <p>Michael Haywird said he remembers feeling a big bang about 10 seconds after take-off.</p>
        
            <p>He was sitting just behind the wing and said he could feel the heat of the flames through the cabin.</p>
