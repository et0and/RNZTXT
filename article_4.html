            <p>Of the new cases, 1617 were reinfections.</p>
        
            <p>There were 169 cases in hospital and none in ICU.</p>

            <p>Last week, Te Whatu Ora reported 2772 new cases of Covid-19 over the week, and 31 further deaths attributed to the virus.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora also noted last week it had updated the 24 June figures, correcting an issue with reported cases and related hospital admissions which had led to an undercount being published.</p>
