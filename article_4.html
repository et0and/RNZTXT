            <p>The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of New Zealand (AOPANZ) says its members are "deeply upset" over a fatal crash involving a light aircraft which participated in the association's annual Autumn Fly-in.</p>
        
            <p>One person died and another was flown to Dunedin Hospital in a critical condition after the aircraft crashed near lake Hawea on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the east of the lake at about 1.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>AOPANZ president Sue Kronfeld said the aircraft was among those who had flown from around the country to be a part of the association's event over the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>"The association and its members are shocked and deeply upset by news of the crash. Our deepest sympathies go out to the loved ones of those who were on board.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't speculate on what has gone wrong. The cause of the crash is now for the police and aviation authorities to investigate. AOPANZ will assist the authorities in any way requested," Kronfeld said.</p>
        
            <p>A scene guard was placed at the crash site overnight and The Civil Aviation Authority was investigating the cause of the crash.</p>
