            <p>The holiday road toll stands at two, and both sides of State Highway 2 has been closed in Lower Hutt, after a crash.</p>
        
            <p>A motorcyclist died after a crash involving a car in Parkvale, Tauranga, on Christmas Eve, a police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>And one person died at the scene after a single vehicle crash in the Auckland suburb of Wharehine, on Pah Hill Road just after 10pm, on 24 December.</p>
        
            <p>On Christmas morning, police said emergency services were responding to a crash involving a motorbike on the Hutt motorway, and both the north and southbound lanes of State Highway 2 were closed at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The crash, about 9:15am, was between the Haywards Hill Road off-ramp and Hebden Crescent.</p>
        
            <p>The motorcyclist was not seriously injured, they said.</p>
        
            <p>The official holiday road toll began at 4pm on Christmas Eve, and ends at 6am on 5 January.</p>
        
            <p>On Christmas Eve, a person died in New Plymouth before the official holiday period had begun, after a car crashed into a house.</p>
        
            <p>Last summer and the summer before each had 21 deaths on the roads during the holiday period, and there were 16 fatalities in the 2021-2022 period.</p>
        
            <p>Road safety messages to drivers to not take risks during the summer holiday period are being repeated by a host of organisations, with reminders to drive to the conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Among them, freight sector group Transporting New Zealand, which said drivers should expect delays, as there are lots of road works this summer, and trucks remain on the roads delivering essential supplies.</p>
        
            <p>Its chief executive Dom Kalasih said holidaymakers need to be vigilant, and always drive safely.</p>
        
            <p>"Our drivers, unfortunately, they do see some crazy stuff out there - especially dangerous driving. And that can be them being passed when there's not really enough room, or cars oncoming completing passing manoeuvres", he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Many crashes happen where speed, seat belts, distractions and impaired driving - whether that be by fatigue, alcohol or drugs - are contributing factors, and all those things can be managed.</p>
        
            <p>"So we're asking everyone out there to try really hard in those areas."</p>
