            <p>Politicians are being welcomed at the Waitangi Treaty Grounds on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The Parliamentary pōwhiri is a chance each year for politicians to have their say, and for the hau kāinga - home people - and te ao Māori, to respond.</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will not be there but coalition partners Winston Peters and David Seymour will be.</p>
