            <p>A pod of 10 pilot whales stranded in Golden Bay have been re-floated into deep water on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The group of eleven whales were first stranded on Monday near Taupata Point, with one dying,</p>
        
            <p>But volunteers helped guide the whales over sandbars today, which the whales responded well to, Project Jonah said.</p>
        
            <p>The whales began swimming strongly, and eventually were no longer visible.</p>
        
            <p>Project Jonah thanked everyone involved for their response, with many travelling from across the Tasman region.</p>
        
            <p>Beaches will still be checked on Thursday morning and locals should phone in with any concern, Project Jonah said.</p>
