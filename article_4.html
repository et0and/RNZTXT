            <p>Police are thanking the hundreds of people who turned up to search for five-year-old Khyzah near Gisborne this week.</p>
        
            <p>The boy was found dead in a farm pond on Monday afternoon, after he went missing on Sunday at about 2pm on a farm in Hangaroa.</p>
        
            <p>Area Commander Darren Paki told RNZ it has been tough for everyone involved.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not the result anyone wanted. We were trying our very hardest... and our community was trying their hardest to find him alive and well, unfortunately that wasn't the outcome and it's hit everybody hard in the community. We're all in mourning with the whānau.</p>
        
            <p>"The death has been referred to coroner, part of that will be undergoing a post mortem, so we're organising that for today."</p>
        
            <p>About 200 people turned up to help search for the child on Sunday afternoon and Monday morning, and some had driven for hours to be there.</p>
        
            <p>"It just shows you the extent this community pulls together in tough times and it's really heartening for us as police to see that. Police are hugely appreciative of what the community did yesterday, how they all rallied together... I just want to extend our thanks to the community," Paki said.</p>
        
            <p>"We're providing ongoing support to the whānau through our iwi liaison officers and victim support... and will continue to support for as long as they need us."</p>
