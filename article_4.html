            <p>The Nelson/Marlborough region will be the first to see the rollout of an extended breast screening programme, due to its capacity to manage additional demand.</p>
        
            <p>The government has announced it is extending the scheme by five years, to women up to the age of 74, from 69.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Dr Shane Reti said the extension was needed.</p>
        
            <p>"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in New Zealand with about 3400 women diagnosed with the disease each year," Reti said.</p>
        
            <p>"The aim of breast screening is to find breast cancers early - before there are any noticeable symptoms.</p>
        
            <p>"Women who participate in the BreastScreen Aotearoa programme are 34 percent less likely to die from breast cancer.</p>
        
            <p>"That's why earlier this year I announced that the government would extend breast cancer screening to women aged 70-74 - a commitment reinforced through Budget 2024, which delivered $31.2 million for this initiative," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Reti said the Nelson/Marlborough region was a good place to start.</p>
        
            <p>"Nelson/Marlborough has the capability, both the infrastructure and the workforce, to start rolling out this programme. The full implementation will be in a year's time, and this gives us the opportunity to iron out any wrinkles, or anything else we need to," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Four thousand to 5000 people have become eligible under the extension in the region, Reti said.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora Breast Screen South general manager Louise McCarthy said she was delighted that more local women, including wāhine Māori and Pacific women who were more likely to get breast cancer, would have access to extra mammograms.</p>
        
            <p>"Our partnership with Te Piki Oranga, a local Māori health service provider and relationships with other stakeholders will help to improve access to breast screening for Māori and Pacific women.</p>
        
            <p>"Early detection across Nelson Marlborough will undoubtedly lead to better health outcomes - for the individual and the wider whānau and community," McCarthy said.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora National Public Health Services Director Prevention Alana Ewe-Snow said it was a huge milestone.</p>
        
            <p>"We're looking forward to extending our services, with the help of Pacific Radiology, and are looking to add a new location for our breast screen mobile unit at Ūkaipō, Wairau, in early 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"Once the age extension within the national breast screening programme is fully implemented, women aged 70 to 74 across the motu will be eligible for an additional two to three free mammograms on average.</p>
        
            <p>"Around 20 lives each year are expected to be saved and around 60,000 additional women will be eligible for screening annually."</p>
        
            <p>The Breast Cancer Foundation chief executive Ah-Leen Rayner said the foundation first started campaigning for the age to be lifted eight years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"We called for this because the women's risk of developing breast cancer does not stop at age 69, in fact, you are more likely to develop breast cancer at the age of 70, than you are at 50."</p>
        
            <p>The national rollout of the extension is scheduled for October 2025.</p>
