            <p>Police are investigating the sudden death of an inmate at Mt Eden prison.</p>
        
            <p>Mt Eden Corrections Facility General Manager Dion Paki said the prisoner was found in his single bed cell on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Our staff made every effort to save him, however they were sadly unable to revive him."</p>
        
            <p>There is no indication that the prisoner's death is suspicious, but an investigation is underway, Paki said.</p>
        
            <p>"All deaths in prison are subject to an internal incident review, investigation by the independent Corrections Inspectorate and are also referred to the Coroner.</p>
        
            <p>"The inspectorate and Coroner both complete a robust independent assessment of each incident providing commentary and recommendations regarding the care and treatment of deceased individuals. In addition, the Coroner confirms the cause of death."</p>
        
            <p>Police confirmed the man's next of kin had been advised of his passing.</p>
        
            <p>"Other men in the unit and staff are being provided with support, including access to chaplains and cultural support where requested," Paki said.</p>
