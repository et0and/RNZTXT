            <p>A man is facing charges after a car chase that ended with a family member taking a gun off a driver, police say.</p>
        
            <p>They said a 31-year-old Head Hunters associate was speeding on the Southern Motorway near East Tamaki about 7.30pm on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>An Eagle helicopter followed the car as it weaved in and out of traffic before it reached Glen Innes and drove through a fence.</p>
        
            <p>Police allege the driver was carrying a gun but the standoff was defused when a family member took it off the man.</p>
        
            <p>They say officers later found an assault rifle inside the car.</p>
        
            <p>The man was due to appear in Auckland District Court Thursday on charges including unlawfully possessing a prohibited firearm, unlawfully possessing a prohibited magazine, presenting a firearm, reckless driving and failing to stop.</p>
