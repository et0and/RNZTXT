            <p>Canterbury's Muslim community will today gather to commemorate the Christchurch mosque shootings.</p>
        
            <p>On 15 March 2019, a gunman opened fire at Masjid Annur and the Linwood Islamic Centre.</p>
        
            <p>Within about quarter of an hour, he had massacred or mortally wounded 51 worshippers.</p>
        
            <p>Dozens more were injured.</p>
        
            <p>This year's fifth anniversary falls on Jumu'ah - the mandatory Islamic Friday prayer.</p>
        
            <p>It was that occasion five years ago which the terrorist targeted.</p>

            <p>Abdur Razzaq, of the Federation of Islamic Associations, said today was a solemn but important day.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a very, very important day. But let's not forget, for the survivors and whƒÅnau the trauma is ongoing - it's every day, not just on March 15th," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The day would be commemorated by Muslims throughout the country.</p>
        
            <p>In Christchurch, worshippers would mark Jumu'ah ahead of a commemoration service at Masjid Annur in the evening.</p>
        
            <p>It would be attended by the communities of both mosques, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, opposition leader Chris Hipkins, Sir William Young - who chaired the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the attacks, as well as representatives from government agencies and local schools and first responders.</p>
        
            <p>"It will be to respect and remember the shuhada and the survivors," Razzaq said.</p>
        
            <p>There were three themes underlying the event - the wellbeing and welfare of survivors and the memory of the shuhada (the martyrs of the attack); remembering and reaffirming the aroha shown by the wider New Zealand community in response to the attack; and to remember the lessons learned.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to understand that hate is out there. We have to work through our differences, but diversity is important - it provides a rich tapestry for our culture in New Zealand. We have to appreciate each other's differences and respect that," Razzaq said.</p>
        
            <p>Recalling the support and outpouring of grief from New Zealand in response to the attack was also very important, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It was actually the start of the healing process.</p>
        
            <p>"It brought the whole of New Zealand together and it's not only enduring, but also very much endearing for all of us."</p>
        
            <p>The support of Aotearoa was also at the forefront of Farid Ahmed's mind.</p>
        
            <p>Ahmed was a survivor of the shooting at Masjid Annur, but his wife was killed in the attack.</p>
        
            <p>He commanded international respect and recognition in the wake of the terror attack by publicly forgiving the gunman and calling for everyone to follow a path of peace and forgiveness.</p>

            <p>Today's commemorations were an opportunity to remember the victims and the way the tragedy brought the country together, Ahmed said.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand has made a remarkable example after 15 March and they have become world champions in compassion," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Those are the things that even today move me and tomorrow it will move me, and I know that this is the feeling of our Muslim community."</p>
        
            <p>He was also proud of the example set by Muslims around Aotearoa and in Christchurch in particular.</p>
        
            <p>"After the great pain and suffering they took, they have done the right thing and the right thing is they took the path of peace - without any violence, without hate for hate, without cruelty for cruelty," Ahmed said.</p>
        
            <p>"They have also shown their compassion. That we can go through the pain, but we should do the right thing."</p>
