            <p>Immigration New Zealand has announced a one-time increase in the parent visa quota, allowing more approved applications to be processed this financial year.</p>
        
            <p>The annual cap for the parent visa category typically stands at 2500, with 2000 visas allocated to queue-based applications and 500 to ballot-based applicants.</p>
        
            <p>However, due to a backlog, Immigration Minister Erica Stanford has authorised an additional 331 queue-based visas, bringing the total to 2331 for the financial year ending 30 June.</p>
        
            <p>The ballot allocation remains unchanged at 500 visas, and the overall 2500 cap will be reinstated for 2025-26 financial year.</p>
        
            <p>INZ will contact applicants whose queue-based expressions of interest are selected.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has reported that thousands of families are growing increasingly frustrated with long delays and a lottery system that determines whether their overseas parents can join them permanently.</p>
        
            <p>About 12,000 parents of residents and citizens are waiting, but only 500 people have been picked to apply in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Those in the random ballot, held every three months, must be drawn before they can even apply for residence. Some parents have reportedly died while waiting.</p>
        
            <p>Beyond those in the ballot system, some parents are waiting for updates on a possible long-term visitor visa as an alternative pathway to residency.</p>
