        <p>
People "should not be touching" the orange water, which could have been caused by a mine shaft collapsing.

            <p>The Waikato Regional Council is sending out a warning about bright orange water in the Ohinemuri River.</p>
        
            <p>It said the discolouration could be due to a mine shaft collapsing and the water should be treated as contaminated.</p>
        
            <p>The incident was reported to the council at about 3pm.</p>
        
            <p>Council staff are at the river and are assessing the discoloration.</p>
        
            <p>Senior incident response officer Robert Isaac said staff had yet to identify the source of the discolouration, which appeared to enter the Ohinemuri River downstream of the Waitawheta River.</p>
        
            <p>"Until we can ID the source we need to treat this as worst-case scenario as we are getting reports of people standing in the water.</p>
        
            <p>"If this is an old mine shaft that has blown out than people should not be using or touching the water."</p>
        
            <p>Other scenarios could include a collapsed forestry dam or other erosion.</p>
