            <p>A hearing starts on Monday to determine the scope and form of a coronial inquiry into the death of the LynnMall terror attacker more than two years ago.</p>
        
            <p>Ahamed Samsudeen was fatally shot by the police after stabbing multiple people in a West Auckland supermarket in September 2021, shortly after his release from prison.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Marcus Elliott will conduct the hearing, which is set down for two-and-a-half days in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>He will consider the findings of five state agency investigations and previous judicial decisions and hear submissions from survivors, the police, Immigration, Corrections and Samsudeen's family.</p>
        
            <p>He will also consider whether a public hearing, an inquest, is warranted.</p>
        
            <p>Coroners investigate the facts of a death and can make recommendations to help prevent similar deaths.</p>
        
            <p>Samsudeen seriously injured four women and one man with a knife during the attack at Countdown in LynnMall in 2021 before he was shot dead by police who were following him.</p>
        
            <p>Another man suffered a minor wound, and a third dislocated his shoulder while trying to stop the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Samsudeen had been monitored since 2015 because of his interest in the Islamic State and he was arrested at Auckland Airport in 2017. The authorities believed he was a threat to national security and that he was trying to join ISIS in Syria.</p>
        
            <p>He spent most of the next four years on remand in jail.</p>
        
            <p>In May 2021, he was found guilty of possessing undesirable publications. Due to the length of time he had spent in custody, he was sentenced to a year of supervision.</p>
        
            <p>He carried out the LynnMall attack just months later.</p>
        
            <p>There have been five state agency investigations into the events leading up to Samsudeen's death, addressing a range of factors including his background, the police response, Corrections' management of him in custody and on remand, and Immigration's involvement from the time he entered New Zealand.</p>
