            <p>A public health researcher is calling for the government to leave home insulation standards as they are.</p>
        
            <p>Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk is considering reducing the amount required, amid concerns it is adding tens-of-thousands of dollars onto the cost of a home.</p>
        
            <p>An upgrade to insulation and glazing requirements was made in May 2023, the first improvements in more than a decade.</p>
        
            <p>Otago University Public Health researcher Lucy Telfar-Barnard says there is solid evidence for retaining the improved standards.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a 20-year history of solid research in Aotearoa New Zealand showing that insulation not only improves energy efficiency but also our health, with the benefits of insulation outweighing its costs," Telfar-Barnard said.</p>
        
            <p>"Less insulation means more health sector costs and lower productivity. Even a top-up to existing insulation provides health benefits that make it worthwhile. The health and social benefits of insulation are nearly six times greater than the cost of the insulation," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Penk told Checkpoint in July new houses could include costs of $40,000 to $50,000 extra depending on the insulation standard they were held to.</p>
        
            <p>"The evidence is that construction costs have increased by 41 percent since 2019. Housing affordability is the second-worst in the OECD as I understand it. ...When people are saying - the ones who build the homes - are that there are $40,000 or even $50,000 additional costs to new builds, simply that makes housing unaffordable for many Kiwis," Penk said.</p>
        
            <p>But Telfar-Barnard said she had been speaking with people in the building industry, who said that number does not add up.</p>
        
            <p>She said reversing the changes will take insulation standards back to about half or even less of the levels required in places like Australia, Ireland and the UK.</p>
