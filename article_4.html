            <p>Aucklanders will have a say next year about changes the council want to make to the region's dog rules.</p>
        
            <p>The proposed bylaw includes limits on the number of dogs that can be walked at once, which regional parks dogs can visit and that menacing dogs must be neutered.</p>
        
            <p>This week, Auckland Council's regulatory and safety committee backed plans for public consultation on the Dog Policy and Dog Management Bylaw to go ahead next year.</p>
        
            <p>The mayor and councillors will decide later when this will be.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, committee chair councillor Josephine Bartley said testing the proposed changes with Aucklanders was a key part of the policy review process.</p>
        
            <p>"Dogs can be a great part of life in Auckland," Bartley said.</p>
        
            <p>"They can become our best friends, and we have lots of fantastic places to get out and enjoy with our dogs in TƒÅmaki Makaurau."</p>
        
            <p>The aim of the update to the dog laws was to help, "keep pooches a positive part of our lives".</p>
        
            <p>"We want to maintain a mix of dog-friendly and dog-free spaces, so there are public spaces that everyone can enjoy, and to help keep Aucklanders, our environment and wildlife safe too."</p>
        
            <p>The Dog Policy and Dog Management Bylaw was reviewed every few years, to check it still met the needs of Aucklanders.</p>
        
            <p>Council proposed changes to include updating where dogs can and cannot go at 14 of Auckland's regional parks, setting limits on the number of dogs that can be walked at once and make the policy and bylaw easier to understand by clarifying some of the existing rules.</p>
        
            <p>These included requirements to neuter dogs classified as menacing, including those that have been relocated from outside Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Proposed changes to where dogs can and cannot go at some local parks and beaches were also being considered by local boards.</p>
        
            <p>"We know many Aucklanders love their dogs, so updating this policy is not something we are doing lightly.</p>
        
            <p>"The changes being proposed have been shaped by robust data and feedback. They also reflect the different ways that some public places are being used now, compared to when the policy was last reviewed in 2019."</p>

            <p>Bartley said some areas were no longer suitable for dogs, with endangered birds nesting, kauri growing, or were well-used by families.</p>
        
            <p>Preliminary feedback from a public survey in March 2024 showed the common issues for Aucklanders were owners not picking up after their dog, packs of dogs taking up pathways, and dogs wandering off-leash in an on-leash area.</p>
        
            <p>An analysis of complaints data found that most dog-related complaints were about dog access rules not being followed, and multiple dogs were being walked together.</p>
        
            <p>Council staff also analysed statistics from animal management service requests, multiple dog ownership licences, registrations, and the animal management annual report.</p>
        
            <p>A review of the National Survey of Dog Attacks data, dog control statistics and Accident Compensation Corporation's dog related claims was done.</p>
        
            <p>Council said they interviewed groups, including Auckland SPCA, commercial dog walkers, Chained Dog Rehabilitation and Rehoming and Friends of Regional Parks.</p>
        
            <p>"Council staff have carried out a thorough review of the data and this has informed the proposed changes to the dog policy."</p>
        
            <p>Bartley said the level of due diligence was vital when recommending changes to policies and bylaws.</p>
        
            <p>"Now we want Aucklanders to have their say on these proposals."</p>
