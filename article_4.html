            <p>Police have arrested a person after a threatening phone call saw Tauranga Hospital plunged into lockdown for five hours.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga Hospital said just before midday on Thursday it had received a "threatening phone call from a member of the public".</p>
        
            <p>The hospital had been locked down as a precaution.</p>
        
            <p>Armed officers were at each entrance stopping visitors from entering.</p>

            <p>However, the emergency department remained open throughout the lockdown and patients could attend appointments at their scheduled time, the hospital said.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the armed officers were there to "provide reassurance", but they were "confident" there was no immediate threat to staff, patients or the premises.</p>
        
            <p>About 4.40pm, police said a person had been taken into custody over the incident.</p>
        
            <p>The lockdown had now been lifted, police said.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter said there were about 50 people in the carpark earlier while the incident was unfolding.</p>
