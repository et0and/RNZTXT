            <p>Better weather is returning after the holiday weekend of downpours and snow, though rain is lingering in the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>Flooding and snow in the South Island over Labour Weekend closed roads and stranded motorists over Labour Weekend, while heavy rain and thunderstorms hit much of the country.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law said it was amazing the season could change that much.</p>
        
            <p>"That Saturday had everything in it, heavy rainfall, strong winds and that snowfall. Last Tuesday it was 22C in Mount Cook and by the time we got through towards Saturday, almost half a metre of snowfall."</p>
        
            <p>Snow wasn't unheard of this time of year, but the amount was unusual, he told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>Though the weather had settled on Monday, Law said more showers are on the way across the North Island on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Hawkes Bay gets the warmest temperatures in the country on Tuesday, with Napier and Hastings to reach 24C, while Gisborne Tai RƒÅwhiti is due to have a maximum 22C.</p>
        
            <p>At the same time rain could be "fairly heavy" during the day and there was the possibility of thunder on the western coast of the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>"As we head through the week some better weather comes back," he said though it wouldn't be "brilliantly warm".</p>
        
            <p>There were no weather warnings in place on Tuesday morning.</p>
