            <p>An Auckland college was evacuated today after a chemical spill.</p>
        
            <p>The principal of St. Cuthbert's College in Epsom said jars containing chemicals were broken and leaked into a room in the art department around midday.</p>
        
            <p>"A staff member was preparing to empty a set of shelves containing historic biological specimen glass jars," Principal Charlotte Avery said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, one of the shelves collapsed and some specimen jars were broken."</p>
        
            <p>Avery said the building was evacuated and the Fire Service was called, and the building was thoroughly cleaned and aired out.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John said nine patients were assessed and treated at the scene for minor concerns, and no-one was transported to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>"Our absolute priority was the safety of our students and staff.</p>
        
            <p>"One of our teachers came into contact with the substance, and some of our students have been impacted by fumes.</p>
        
            <p>"Our staff and students are safe. Students impacted by the fumes have had their eyes washed. As a precaution we ensured our Junior School students played inside during break time."</p>
        
            <p>The building would soon be safe for entry again, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand that the substance in the jars was a type of formaldehyde, which was stored in a locked cabinet. We are currently reviewing all our storage of historic specimens which will be removed."</p>
