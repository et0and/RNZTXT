            <p>Police have searched two properties and examined two vehicles in their hunt for Ronny Okeke who was last seen 47 days ago.</p>
        
            <p>Officers have also spoken to a person of interest as they build a picture of the movements of the 60-year-old Sandringham man for whom they hold "grave concerns".</p>

            <p>"No arrests have been made at this point, but I can confirm we have since spoken with a person of interest in relation to Ronny's disappearance," Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin of Auckland CIB said.</p>
        
            <p>"We now have information that an altercation occurred between this man and Ronny on, or around, 27 April.</p>
        
            <p>"It is believed Ronny may have been injured as a result, but as for the severity of any injuries we still do not know."</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Baldwin said two search warrants were conducted in late May, at addresses in Mt Eden and Ramarama.</p>
        
            <p>Police have also examined two vehicles of interest. Forensic testing was being carried out on several samples and items.</p>
        
            <p>Okeke was last seen on 27 April and police say his whereabouts since then have remained a mystery.</p>
        
            <p>Police have not charged the man they interviewed and no other arrests have been made in connection with his disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>"What we do know is that this altercation occurred, and Ronny has not been heard from since," Detective Inspector Baldwin said.</p>
        
            <p>"The investigation team are continuing to keep an open mind around Ronny's disappearance but we undoubtedly have grave concerns for him at this point."</p>
        
            <p>The investigation team have since recovered Okeke's mobile phone.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an important piece in the puzzle and work is ongoing to interrogate the phone, and extract all possible relevant information," Baldwin said.</p>
        
            <p>Police still want to hear from anyone who has information about the events of 27 April or who has seen Okeke.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have information or if you have been involved in helping Ronny lay low, or seek medical attention, I urge you to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>"Ronny's family are nearing two months without hearing from him, and being overseas they are understandably distressed and concerned for him."</p>
        
            <p>Police can be contacted on 105 or going online, using 'Update My Report'. The file number is 240501/3879.</p>
