            <p>A homicide investigation is underway after the death of a man in Te Awamutu.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said it received a call to an incident on Te Rahu Road about 11.45pm on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>A man was found unconscious and despite medical intervention, he died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Police have since arrested a 27-year-old man and a 34-year-old woman who were at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>"They are now assisting police with our investigation and charges are being considered.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are very early in our investigation and our focus is on establishing the circumstances leading into the incident and to support the victim's family.</p>
        
            <p>"Police cannot rule out the possibility of further arrests as the investigation progresses."</p>
        
            <p>A woman and five younger people were sitting on the side of Te Rahu Road outside the police cordon.</p>
        
            <p>When approached by RNZ, the woman, who has a duvet wrapped around her, said it was her "husband on the side of the road up there".</p>
        
            <p>The woman said she was waiting for her husband's body to be removed and she did not want to talk to anyone.</p>
        
            <p>Police said a scene examination was being carried out and traffic management was in place.</p>
        
            <p>People could expect to see an increased presence of police in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information about the man's death was asked to contact police on 105 or online, quoting reference number 241016/0455.</p>
