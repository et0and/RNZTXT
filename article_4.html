            <p>A number of phone calls between the defendants and their associates have been heard during Rau Tongia's murder trial.</p>
        
            <p>Shayde Carolyn Weston, Breeze Hunt-Weston, Louise Kelly Hume, and Pania Ella Waaka have all pleaded not guilty to the murder of Tongia, who the Crown allege was shot in the back while he slept at a house in Wellington's Karori in December 2020.</p>
        
            <p>In the hours before Tongia's death, the Crown alleged he assaulted Weston and his death was a revenge killing.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown believed Weston either pulled the trigger or assisted in the shooting, Waaka drove Weston to the address, Hunt-Weston lent them the car to get there, and Hume supplied the gun used.</p>
        
            <p>A fifth person was due to go on trial but has not appeared due to health issues.</p>
        
            <p>Police were able to intercept a number of calls in the weeks following Tongia's death.</p>
        
            <p>Several were between Hunt-Weston, Hume, Weston and Phoenix Colvin.</p>
        
            <p>Police had previously provided evidence of a car linked to Colvin being at Tongia's address following the assault. She was also charged back in 2022 for her involvement with a gun allegedly used in killing.</p>
        
            <p>On Thursday, the court heard phone calls following the police's discovery of a gun in a black Mazda.</p>
        
            <p>Callers identified Colvin and her partner at the time, Tricq Brown, as being in the car when the gun was found.</p>
        
            <p>The calls included concern over how the weapon had been found, anger over Colvin's role in the events and denials they had anything to do with the death.</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
