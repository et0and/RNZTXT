            <p>Fewer Auckland residents would be at risk in the event of a tsunami than the council previously thought.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Emergency Management (AEM) has updated the region's tsunami map in the wake of new data which it says showed less of the city's coastline would be at threat.</p>
        
            <p>AEM head of operations John Cranfield said the data used more accurate modelling of tsunamis which replicated earthquakes, and the movement of water, onto the region's shores.</p>
        
            <p>It showed fewer residents living on Auckland shoreline, Hauraki Gulf Islands, and Aotea Great Barrier Island would need to evacuate.</p>
        
            <p>But Cranfield said, while there was a lower risk, much of Auckland's shoreline was still in the red.</p>
        
            <p>He encouraged all Aucklanders to check if they operated in or around any of the zones.</p>
        
            <p>"We've still got a huge job, as does everyone. The key thing is really preparation - be prepared. The catchline is really, 'know your zone,' so know the zone you live, work or play in, and you can do that by visiting our website."</p>
        
            <p>Knowing the natural signs to evacuate was also an invaluable skill, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If its long or strong, get gone," he re-iterated.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland's north-east coastlines, the Hauraki Gulf Islands, were especially still at greater risk in the case of a tsunami, as was Orewa because of its denser coast population, Cranfield said.</p>
