        <h2>New Wellington City Mission opens: 'To safeguard, protect and nurture'</h2>
        <p>
There is no "us and them" at Whakamaru, Wellington City Mission's new $50 million facility.

            <p>There is no "us and them" at Whakamaru, Wellington City Mission's new $50 million facility.</p>
        
            <p>Sitting in a booth at Craig and Gail's - the public cafe that occupies much of the ground floor - City Missioner Murray Edridge said it was surreal to see the project finally complete after six years of dreaming, planning and building.</p>
        
            <p>"This is way beyond our expectations, and our dreams, and our ambitions, and our aspirations," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The building is beautiful ... but it'll really become beautiful when there's people in here."</p>
        
            <p>That will begin today, with Governor General Dame Cindy Kiro officially opening the building on Oxford Terrace - just off busy Adelaide Road in the suburb of Mount Cook.</p>
        
            <p>The name - Whakamaru - was gifted by Te Ati Awa, and means to safeguard, protect and nurture.</p>
        
            <p>Funded largely by the community, with support from the government and Wellington City Council, Whakamaru is a place for people from all walks of life to gather, get a coffee or kai, or seek help.</p>

            <p>The light, airy building stretches five floors and 5500 square metres. Every one of those is carefully considered. Behind every door, around every corner, there's a special space.</p>
        
            <p>A suite of showers, washing machines and dryers is tucked behind the cafe.</p>
        
            <p>"If you haven't got anywhere to live, if you're living rough, or if you're staying in a house - and there's many of these in the community - where they don't have hot water, then this is a privilege," said Edridge.</p>
        
            <p>There is a dental surgery, a medical centre, meeting spaces, a chapel - which is already booked for a wedding next month - and on the top two floors, 35 long-term transitional housing apartments, for those who need "a bit of extra support", said Edridge.</p>
        
            <p>A social supermarket is stocked with quality goods, and runs on a points system, with points allocated depending on the size of a whƒÅnau.</p>
        
            <p>It is just like walking into a supermarket, and there are even tills - but no cash.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about ... how do we do dignity and respect in the context of food supply, and the obvious answer is, you invite people into shop."</p>

            <p>But Edridge described Craig and Gail's as the jewel in Whakamaru's crown.</p>
        
            <p>"'Come and have a coffee with me at Craig and Gail's', it sounds like someone's home," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The beauty of this cafe is that you can come and get amazing kai, great coffee, best coffee in Wellington ... but best of all you get to sit next to someone who may not look like you, may not have what you have, may be at a different place in their journey, so that makes this a very special place."</p>
        
            <p>The 'contribute what you can' model means people can choose to pay what their meal is worth, or more, if they want to pay it forward. Less, if they don't have enough, or nothing, if they have no money that day.</p>
        
            <p>"And that's okay... you'll be treated exactly the same," Edridge said.</p>

            <p>When the doors close to the public, it continues as a 24/7 crisis recovery cafe for those who might otherwise end up at the hospital or with the police, but just need a cup of tea and some support, or a referral to a health or social service.</p>
        
            <p>Whakamaru was designed to ensure everyone in the community can uphold their dignity, and connect with others, said Edridge.</p>
        
            <p>"The recent increase in demand for our services shows us there is a critical need for us all to re-think how we 'do community'," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Whakamaru will re-shape how Wellingtonians support and care for each other, bringing us all together under one roof and eliminating the divide between 'us and them'."</p>
        
            <p>After the official opening on Wednesday, there would be a phased opening for staff and manuhiri who the Mission serve, with Whakamaru opening to the public on 18 November.</p>
