        <h2>Plan unveiled for Nelson facility combining three civic assets</h2>
        <p>
A proposal to develop a new facility combining Nelson's library and civic centre with a community hub has been suggested to help revitalise the city centre, at a cost of $90 million.

            <p>A proposal to develop a new facility combining Nelson's library and civic centre with a community hub has been suggested to help revitalise the city centre, at a cost of $90 million.</p>
        
            <p>The plan was unveiled at a summit in Nelson focused on how to grow the city and the council's chief executive Nigel Philpott said combining the three facilities into one, would tackle multiple issues.</p>
        
            <p>He said two of the council's key facilities - the Elma Turner Library and Civic House - were becoming increasingly expensive to maintain, had inherent limitations and were no longer fit for purpose.</p>
        
            <p>The council bought Civic House in the 1980s, it had not had any further investment since which meant there was significant deferred maintenance, and an earthquake prone roof which Philpott said left "staff working in, quite frankly unsatisfactory conditions".</p>
        
            <p>The Elma Turner Library, a former car showroom, recently had strengthening work at a cost of $2.5m completed after seismic issues were found in the roof. It extended the life of the facility by up to 10 years, but the site remained vulnerable to climate change.</p>
        
            <p>Plans to build a $46m library on the banks of the Maitai River were shelved in 2022 after the severe flood event caused millions of dollars worth of damage to the community, with the cost also considered unaffordable in the current economic environment.</p>

            <p>Philpott said the indicative business case for the new facility, produced by TwentyTwo Independent Property Advisers, highlighted the need to urgently push forward with a new civic investment.</p>
        
            <p>"We are in a cost of living crisis and the cost of delivering council activity has gone up exponentially."</p>

            <p>TwentyTwo managing director Dean Croucher said the report looked at how the council could best renew its assets while meeting its strategic goals and the community's aspirations.</p>
        
            <p>He said many regions were facing the decline of the traditional town centre.</p>
        
            <p>"A commitment by council to invest in a new library, community hub and civic centre sends a positive message to the community and other landowners and businesses that council itself is prepared to invest in the renewal of the city centre."</p>
        
            <p>Other centres, like Taupō, Napier and Tauranga, had used civic investment as a catalyst for urban renewal.</p>

            <p>There were also examples closer to home, with the Marlborough Library - Te Kahu o Waipuna in Blenheim, Te Noninga Kumu - Motueka Public Library and the Picton Library and Service Centre Waitohi Whare Mātauranga.</p>
        
            <p>"Many of these examples involve facilities with a sense of place and while they may include a library, increasingly they are more contemporary spaces and do more than just store books on shelves," Croucher said.</p>
        
            <p>"They are places that focus on supporting collaboration, innovation and experience by providing public meeting, multi-purpose, flexible spaces and often cafes. These are for functions, learning, cultural and community events, for people of all ages."</p>
        
            <p>The council was faced with choosing to further invest in ageing assets, or develop a new facility that provided more contemporary facilities and amenities for its community and workforce, Croucher said.</p>
        
            <p>The preferred option was for council to invest in a single site development with a library, community hub and civic centre together, at an estimated cost of $90m.</p>
        
            <p>It would also mean the two existing buildings could be re-purposed, adding to the wider re-investment of the city centre.</p>
        
            <p>
The roof of Civic House is earthquake prone. In 2022, two notices were issued that apply to the roof of the tower block and parts of the building that have suspended heavy ceiling tiles that do not meet 34 percent of the New Building Standard (NBS).

            <p>The refurbishment of Civic House was deemed impractical and unviable with an estimated cost of $54.5m.</p>
        
            <p>It would result in overcapitalising the asset, with around $37.6m needed to upgrade the building, $7.9m to fit out the council offices and $9m in temporary costs, leasing and fitting out an alternative office space for council staff, without the addition of a library or community hub.</p>
        
            <p>Croucher said further work was needed to validate the shortlisted options and forecast costs.</p>
        
            <p>"Council needs to engage with the market both initially, perhaps through a market sounding process, and more formally through a procurement process in due course. This work would lead to more refined options, costs, timeframes and risks being identified."</p>
        
            <p>Nelson Mayor Nick Smith said no decision had been made on the report and no sites yet identified for the new facility, but it was an important issue for the city and council had released the report so the community could digest it.</p>
        
            <p>"Any major civic project of that sort needs a long runway and also requires a large amount of community engagement."</p>
        
            <p>The 2024-2034 Draft Long Term Plan (LTP) retained the $65m currently provisioned for a new library and refurbished civic centre, he said.</p>
        
            <p>If supported by the community after a full consultation process, the project would require an additional $20m in the council's Long Term Plan over and above the $65m in order to be advanced.</p>
