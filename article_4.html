            <p>Family of the man who was shot in Wairarapa over the weekend have been removed from the courtroom after creating a disturbance as one of the men charged with his death appeared in court.</p>
        
            <p>Both men appeared in the Wellington District Court on Monday and were granted interim name supression. They were both remanded in custody.</p>
        
            <p>Doreion Peri Ropata Hard, 23, died on Saturday after he was found in a vehicle with a gunshot wound in Carterton.</p>
        
            <p>It follows a gun being shot at a vehicle leaving the Fresh Choice supermarket car park in Featherston, heading on to State Highway 2 at 4pm Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Two men, aged 23 and 25, were arrested and charged with murder.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier on Monday morning during the first appearance, two family members of Hard were escorted out of court after yelling profanities at the defendant.</p>
        
            <p>"You killed our family member," one yelled.</p>
        
            <p>"I'll be waiting for you," the other threatened.</p>
        
            <p>The pair will next appear in the High Court at Wellington on 11 April.</p>
