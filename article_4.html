            <p>Auckland Council is giving the go-ahead for a congestion charging scheme to be designed.</p>
        
            <p>The 'time of use' charging could reduce Auckland's traffic by 8 to 12 percent, the council said, referring to a Ministry of Transport report from 2020.</p>
        
            <p>The charge would speed up traffic without waiting for expensive and unaffordable motorways to be built, Auckland mayor Wayne Brown said.</p>
        
            <p>"This will make roads less congested for Aucklanders," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's about making the most of what we have and bringing Auckland in line with similar cities. It's a tried and tested solution, and one that's relatively low-cost."</p>
        
            <p>The scheme could apply at different times or in different locations.</p>
        
            <p>The council was counting on it to help increase public transport use and reduce carbon emissions.</p>
        
            <p>A host of stakeholders will provide input for the design which will then be thrown to the public for consultation.</p>
        
            <p>If successful, the scheme will be launched alongside the City Rail Link in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>But ÅŒtara-Papatoetoe Local Board chair Apulu Reece Autagavaia said in May that the proposal did not consider the needs of South Auckland households. Private vehicles were a need for a lot of the community, who did not have a reliable alternative, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport will look at sharing technology with Waka Kotahi New Zealand Transport Agency to cut the costs of setting up the city's congestion charging scheme.</p>
        
            <p>It is not yet known which roads will incur a charge, how many cameras will be needed and how the charge will vary during peak times.</p>
