            <p>Fire controllers are hopeful all residents evacuated because of wildfires in north Otago will be able to return home later on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Ten fire crews, comprising 35 firefighters and one digger, remain on the scene after a series of fires broke out at Nenthorn, near Middlemarch shortly after midnight on Monday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Two crews monitored the fireground overnight and put out hotspots.</p>
        
            <p>Another fire which broke out in the Earthquakes area, about 7km from Duntroon, has burned through about 30 hectares of conservation land.</p>
        
            <p>All fires are now contained.</p>
        
            <p>No homes were lost in the fire, but a small number of farm buildings were destroyed or damaged, with crews on Tuesday overhauling burnt buildings and felling dangerous nearby trees.</p>
        
            <p>The fires burned through 78 hectares of farmland. Three households were evacuated, but most residents had been cleared to return home.</p>
        
            <p>Incident controller Bobby Lamont said one resident was still unable to return home, but was hopeful they should be able to later on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Lamont said Nenthorn, Ramrock and Butter and Egg Roads remained closed, but were expected to open later on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand has handed over the fireground at the second fire in Earthquakes to Department of Conservation fire crews to monitor and mop up.</p>
        
            <p>Fire investigations were underway for both events.</p>
