            <p>Fifty years after Christchurch hosted the Commonwealth Games, the mayor is aiming to get the sporting event back to the city in 2030.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors meeting on Wednesday morning will consider Mayor Phil Mauger's recommendation that council and ChristchurchNZ look into the viability of the city making a bid to host the Games.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm just floating it out there ... what I'm asking for is a report from our guys to say 'Phil, you're dreaming' or 'no, you're not'," Mauger said.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch needed a major, city-wide event, which internationally promoted the city as being open for business, especially for sporting and cultural events, he said.</p>
        
            <p>He believed the city would be well-equipped to host the Games in 2030, with some help from the wider South Island.</p>
        
            <p>"Now after the earthquake, we've got so many fantastic facilities in Christchurch; with the convention centre, the new stadium will be up and running, the Metro Sports [facility] will be going ... But I don't want to be greedy and have Christchurch have everything; we can send the cycling off down to Invercargill, they've got the Valedrome down there, we can send the rowing to Twizel, because they've got the international rowing lake there."</p>
        
            <p>One of the problems would be sorting accommodation for the athletes, Mauger said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got an area in town that we could build accommodation in, and when it's finished it could be used for student accommodation."</p>
        
            <p>The mayor said he had the support of deputy prime minister Winston Peters.</p>
        
            <p>"He's reasonably keen, he was actually very keen to get it in 2026, but I really think that's a bridge too far, but we'll see how we go."</p>
        
            <p>Mauger wanted staff to provide advice on the viability of Christchurch's bid in August this year.</p>

            <p>The New Zealand Olympic Committee has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>It had previously said New Zealand was not interested in bidding to host the Games in 2030, but it was looking toward a bid for 2034.</p>
        
            <p>The Commonwealth Games were last held in Christchurch in 1974, and in New Zealand in 1990.</p>
        
            <p>Mauger also said he would be writing to neighbouring councils, asking them if they would consider helping fund the $683 million Te Kaha Stadium.</p>
        
            <p>The mayor's monthly report to council said the letter would "seek to test the appetite from Selwyn and Waimakariri for receiving and considering a proposed cost sharing model".</p>
        
            <p>"This is the first formal approach ... we've just got to ask them properly and then it's recorded, and we'll see how we go from there."</p>

            <p>In 2021, the council agreed to a 30,000-seat covered option and had budgeted $453m for the project's construction, the mayor's report said.</p>
        
            <p>The council also agreed with the Crown to allocate an additional $220m towards the construction of Te Kaha out of the government-funded $300m Christchurch Regeneration Acceleration Fund, the report said.</p>
        
            <p>Mauger said the rates impact of the stadium was looking to be 2.7 percent of the current proposed rates increase of 15.8 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Te Kaha is due to be completed midway through 2026, after years of planning conjecture and stalled progress.</p>
        
            <p>Waimakariri Mayor Dan Gordon said currently there was no funding put aside or anticipated in his council's Long Term Plan for Te Kaha.</p>
        
            <p>Both Gordon and Selwyn Mayor Sam Broughton said any contribution to the stadium from their districts would need to be subject to full community consultation.</p>
