            <p>Temperatures will continue to soar in some parts of the country this weekend, with highs of 30 degrees forecast for Napier and Hastings.</p>
        
            <p>It's been a sizzling start to summer, with a brief repreview from the heat coming Friday and Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>However, MetService says by Sunday northwesterlies look set to blast over the country, ushering in a large frontal weather system that will bring heavy rain to the West Coast of the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>A cooler southwesterly flow spreading across the country on Friday brings temperatures back to average for December.</p>
        
            <p>"This respite will be welcome news for those who've struggled through the muggy nights," MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said.</p>
        
            <p>"However, by Sunday, the heat looks set to ramp up again in Hawke's Bay."</p>
        
            <p>Sunday brings a dramatic shift as gusty northwesterlies sweep across the South Island and lower North Island, Makgabutlane warns.</p>
        
            <p>"Gusty northwesterlies will be felt across the South Island and lower North Island, with severe gales possible in exposed areas. Heavy rain is also expected along the western South Island."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the heat looks set to ramp up again - particularly in Hawkes Bay - come Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland should enjoy a fine Saturday with a high of 22 degrees and low of 15 degrees forecast. A partly cloudy Sunday brings with it a forecast high of 25 degrees and a low of 18.</p>
        
            <p>A mainly fine weekend for Napier, with the chance of a shower late afternoon or evening on Saturday. A high of 23 degrees and a low of 15 are forecast.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday the region is forecast to reach 30 degrees, with a low of 20.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings is also set to sizzle; a high of 23 on Saturday, with the chance of a shower late afternoon or everning. A fine Sunday brings with it forecast temps of a high of 30 and a balmy low of 20 degrees.</p>
        
            <p>Fine weather is forecast for Northland, with a high of 25 on Saturday and 26 on Sunday. A low of 14 on Saturday and 17 on Sunday are likely to be accompanied by some cloud and light winds.</p>
        
            <p>With cloudy periods and the chance of a shower or two on Saturday, Gisborne is forecast to reach a high of 24 degrees, with a low of 14.</p>
        
            <p>Come Sunday, the region is another expecting temps in the upper 20s, with northwesterlies and a high of 28 degrees forecast, and a low of 19.</p>
        
            <p>A partly cloudy Saturday with isolated showers clearing early, Christchurch is set to reach a high of 23 degrees and a low of 14.</p>
