            <p>A major highway on the Coromandel peninsula has reopened after being blocked by fallen trees and slips.</p>
        
            <p>Contractors and arborists worked to clear the trees and slips on State Highway 25, between Ruamahunga and Tapu.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi / NZ Transport Agency said a large pine tree fell about 30 metres down the bank onto the Thames Coast Road.</p>
        
            <p>It was closed just after midnight but reopened about 6pm on Monday, under stop-go management.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists should expect longer delays than usual, Waka Kotahi said.</p>
        
            <p>Contractors will back clearing the site and continuing to tidy up on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>The road will be fully closed for short periods on Tuesday to allow trucks to remove slip material.</p>
