            <p>Secrecy surrounds the deaths of two babies a decade ago that are the subject of a heavily suppressed coroner's hearing.</p>
        
            <p>No-one has ever been charged in relation to the children's deaths.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Alexandra Cunninghame was hearing evidence about the deaths in March 2014 and May 2015, which remained the only facts that could be published about the case.</p>
        
            <p>Details suppressed by coroner Cunninghame were themselves suppressed.</p>
        
            <p>Media made submissions in an attempt to be able to publish some details about the deaths, which were suppressed by the coroner under Section 74 of the Coroners Act 2006.</p>
        
            <p>The suppression orders were made on an interim basis.</p>
