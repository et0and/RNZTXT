        <h2>Blackball residents asked to boil water until at least mid-week</h2>
        <p>
Heavy rain means drinking water is being taken from a local river, which is sometimes not of acceptable quality.

            <p>The West Coast town of Blackball will remain under a boil water notice until at least mid-week.</p>
        
            <p>The Grey District Council issued the notice as a precaution for those on the Blackball water supply on Friday afternoon, following a spell of heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>The council's group manager operations Aaron Haymes said it was having to intermittently take water from a local river, which was of lower quality, to replenish its supplies.</p>
        
            <p>Its "turbidity" - haziness or cloudiness - briefly rose above acceptable levels on Friday, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Blackball residents were being asked to boil their water "a little bit longer" and also conserve water, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The council was testing the water supply daily.</p>
