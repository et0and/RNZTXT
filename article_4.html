            <p>The Interislander ferry Kaiārahi has resumed sailing after a technical issue delayed it in Wellington Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said at 1pm the Kaiārahi noted a temperature fault related to a lubrication pump on the Wellington to Picton sailing.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger on the ferry said a call came over the loudspeaker that the technical issue would not be fixed quickly and the vessel would have to return to port in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>But KiwiRail said the ferry had remained in Wellington Harbour as precaution while engineers investigated the issue.</p>
        
            <p>"The fault was quickly resolved and the vessel is now on its way to Picton, around an hour behind schedule," the statement from a spokesperson said.</p>
