            <p>New Zealand's first national tyre recycling scheme is now fully operational.</p>
        
            <p>Under the scheme, named Tyrewise, tyre shops and other tyre generators can have their end-of-life tyres collected for free.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the public can also dispose of up to five worn-out tyres per day, for free, at registered public collection sites around the country.</p>
        
            <p>Environment Minister Penny Simmonds said it marked a significant step toward addressing the long-standing problem of tyre dumping.</p>
        
            <p>"Every year, New Zealand imports around 6.5 million tyres. Of these, only about 40 percent are recycled, reprocessed or exported," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The remainder often end up in landfills, stockpiles, or are illegally dumped. This not only wastes a valuable resource, but it also places a heavy burden on local communities and councils who are usually left to handle the cleanup."</p>
        
            <p>Simmonds said that would change under the new scheme.</p>
        
            <p>The scheme was funded by a tyre stewardship fee which was built into the cost of newly imported tyres from 1 March 2024.</p>
        
            <p>It replaced the old system of ad-hoc disposal fees that many tyre retailers used to charge, Simmonds said.</p>
        
            <p>"The tyre stewardship fee is similar to the disposal charges that New Zealanders were already paying, but with a crucial difference - part of the revenue will now be invested into local infrastructure and into research for new sustainable uses for end-of-life tyres."</p>
        
            <p>The scheme, co-designed with the industry, was a significant step toward a waste system that protected the environment, Simmonds said.</p>
