            <p>A book aiming to break the culture of silence surrounding abuse will be gifted to every primary school.</p>
        
            <p>The Wolf and the Hocus Pocus by New Zealand author Avril McDonald teaches children to trust their instincts and speak out if something is wrong.</p>
        
            <p>With funding from the Wright Family Foundation, the book will be sent out with a guide to help teachers.</p>
        
            <p>The book was launched in April by Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro as part of a broader campaign - supported by Life Education Trust, Women's Refuge and Save the Children - to break the culture of silence around sexual and other forms of abuse in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Cindy said anything that improved the ability of children to deal with complex feelings and with things happening in their lives that they cannot control was hugely important.</p>

            <p>She wanted to see New Zealand do better at encouraging children to speak out and find help.</p>
        
            <p>"We have to look for ways that help children process these feelings, and articulate what's happening to them, and look to supportive friends and adults who can help them deal with it."</p>
        
            <p>McDonald was the author of the Feel Brave series of books, little stories about big feelings for four- to seven-year-olds. She is also the founder of Feel Brave, which aimed to give all children access to tools that help them manage tough emotions and reach their creative potential. Each book told a story about a real-life situation that children might face while offering a simple strategy to cope.</p>
        
            <p>Kylie Wright from the Wright Family Foundation said The Wolf and the Hocus Pocus in particular was a wonderful book that empowered children to use their own voice.</p>
        
            <p>"Avril has done a beautiful job of artistically delivering a powerful message to children that it is okay to speak up if they feel something is wrong, and to seek out a trusted adult.</p>
        
            <p>"Child education is a key focus area for the Wright Family Foundation, and our team are so proud to be supporting the distribution of this delightful book into every primary school across Aotearoa."</p>

            <p>McDonald said she was also delighted that children across the motu would have the chance to read and hear this important story.</p>
        
            <p>"Sometimes a story or one simple strategy can change people's lives," she said. "The Wolf and the Hocus Pocus offers a safe space for children and adults to explore what speaking out might look like and what to do if a child needs help."</p>

            <p>Life Education Trust chief executive Mark Weatherall said the Feel Brave series was a great asset to its teaching.</p>
        
            <p>"With their engaging characters and storylines, they're popular with tamariki right through the primary school years and aid conversations about sensitive topics.</p>
        
            <p>"The Wolf and the Hocus Pocus lets children know it's OK to stand up for themselves and others and will be welcomed by classroom teachers."</p>
