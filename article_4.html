            <p>Four-wheel-drive enthusiasts are being urged to stick to formed roads and take care when driving after several popular historic Queenstown areas were damaged.</p>
        
            <p>Terrain and fragile vegetation damage has been reported at the Macetown, Skippers township and the Chinamans Flat area.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation Whakatipu operations manager David Butt said it was concerning to see the damage caused by off-road vehicles including motorbikes.</p>
        
            <p>"Both Macetown Historic Reserve and Chinamans Flat have suffered from four-wheel-drive vehicle use causing wheel ruts that will likely take decades to heal on the fragile vegetation and soils," Butt said.</p>
        
            <p>"Threatened native birds nest on the gravelly areas of braided rivers such as the Dart River, which is near Chinamans Flat. Please save lives and avoid driving in braided rivers from August, when these birds start nesting, until the end of February."</p>

            <p>Butt said people could enjoy these beautiful locations but the DOC website states vehicles must stay on roads and recognised vehicle tracks.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who damages a public reserve can face imprisonment and a fine under Reserves Act 1997 or the Conservation Act 1987.</p>
        
            <p>Area roading policing manager Steve Watt said the police were also concerned about increased vandalism in backcountry reserves caused by off-road drivers.</p>
        
            <p>"We'd like to remind all users of the Macetown and Skippers tracks these are public roads and normal road rules apply," Watt said.</p>
        
            <p>"We encourage the community to explore what our region has to offer but want people to respect these areas and be considerate so everyone can enjoy them."</p>
        
            <p>Vehicle access to Macetown and Skippers included sections of narrow road with steep drop-offs and blind corners, with the Macetown track involving multiple landslides.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone attempting either track should have experience in rough conditions, ensure the weather conditions before heading out, and be aware that they are responsible for recovering their own vehicles if there is a mishap.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who sees any illegal or suspicious activity is encouraged to contact the 24-hour DOC emergency hotline 0800 DOC HOT (0800 362 468).</p>
