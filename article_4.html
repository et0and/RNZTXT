            <p>The Navy is confident a robust plan is in place to handle any leaks as the operation to remove fuel from the HMNZS Manawanui begins.</p>
        
            <p>Two New Zealand salvage companies are preparing to remove fuel and other pollutants from the vessel that is 30 metres under water after sinking off the coast of Samoa in October.</p>
        
            <p>The ship went down after hitting a reef in a marine reserve off the island of Upolu.</p>
        
            <p>Seventy-five crew and passengers were rescued after being forced to abandon ship.</p>

            <p>Manawanui has nearly 1000 tonnes of automotive gas oil that has diesel-like qualities on board.</p>
        
            <p>Officials estimate up to 200,000 litres of fuel from the ship have leaked into the sea.</p>
        
            <p>Navy Commodore Andrew Brown who is in charge of Operation Resolution said the fuel and other pollutants, such as oils and greases, were set to be removed in the next phase.</p>
        
            <p>Once the salvage was underway, both salvage companies and the Navy would be able to respond quickly if any leaks occurred, he told Checkpoint. </p>
        
            <p>On-site equipment would be able to contain any spillage.</p>
        
            <p>The Navy would also have personnel and equipment on standby in New Zealand if needed.</p>
        
            <p>"The details and methodology that we've gone through and the work that we have done with the salvor gives me confidence that we have the ability to react to any future spillage or leak," Commodore Brown said</p>
        
            <p>The main fuel tanks remained intact and the vessel was being checked daily by divers.</p>
        
            <p>The Navy was monitoring the coastline and the vessel with drones.</p>
        
            <p>"We also walk the coastline on a regular basis and just keep a close eye on the coastline and maritime environment for any changes or pollution."</p>
        
            <p>Samoan authorities have been conducting scientific testing of the water.</p>
        
            <p>It was up to the Samoan government to handle the issue of any compensation for villagers who have lost their income.</p>
        
            <p>"We are supporting the Samoan government with that."</p>
        
            <p>The interim Court of Inquiry report on the sinking had been received by the Chief of Navy. It had been handed over to a Kings Counsel for an independent legal review and then some of the key information would be released publicly, he said.</p>
