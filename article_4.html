            <p>A family friend says the death of a migrant worker at an Auckland workplace has destroyed a family.</p>
        
            <p>A memorial service held for Jun Jiang on Monday in the suburb of Wiri was filled with tears and emotion.</p>
        
            <p>The 37-year-old Chinese national came to New Zealand on a work visa to work for Auckland company SD Aluminium, in late 2022. His wife, Jia Fan, later joined her husband on a partner visa with their 8-year-old daughter.</p>
        
            <p>But Jiang fell from a scissor lift while moving aluminium extrusions at the company's Albany warehouse in December, and died last week in Auckland City Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Jiang's wife Jia Fan and 8-year-old daughter were joined at the funeral home by Jiang's parents, as well as Fan's parents, aunt and uncle, and a few friends, before his body was cremated.</p>
        
            <p>A friend, who was at the service but didn't want to be named, said the incident was devastating for those involved, including Jiang's immediate family, his parents and his in-laws.</p>
        
            <p>"Jun was a very gentle and kind person. He worked hard... and took good care of the family," she told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>She said life would be hard for the widow and the daughter and hoped the government would provide more help with their visa conditions and financial help.</p>
        
            <p>Another family friend, who also did not wish to be named, said he was still in denial about what happened.</p>
        
            <p>"Jun was an intelligent, humble, hard-working, focused man," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He was very meticulous in what he did, very brief in what he spoke, and I was very impressed with his focus and his resolve to do things for his wife and his family."</p>
        
            <p>He said there were lessons to be learned from this incident.</p>
        
            <p>"I think that if migrant workers are brought in, if anybody is brought into our house as guest, we have a responsibility to look after them," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a responsibility to ensure that they are given what New Zealand boasts about - a good-quality and a safe life."</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe said its investigation was ongoing and could take up to 12 months from the date of the incident before the investigation would be complete.</p>
        
            <p>In a response to RNZ on Thursday, ACC deputy chief executive of service delivery Michael Frampton said support available for a family after an accident was assessed on a case by case basis.</p>
        
            <p>"ACC has reached out to a family representative for Jun Jiang about the support and entitlements we may be able to provide, and the family can be assured ACC will process their claim promptly," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The family planned to bring Jiang's ashes to China for a funeral.</p>
