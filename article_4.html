        <h2>How to top NZ music charts</h2>
        <p>
Rokkō's latest number one hit shows that you can record a banger with just a phone, a pair of Apple earphones, and a little bit of courage.

            <p>Apparently, all you need to record a banger is a phone, a pair of Apple earphones, and a little bit of courage.</p>
        
            <p>That's exactly what artist Rokkō Island has shown with his fresh reggae single AVA, which is sitting at number one on the official top 20 New Zealand music charts this week.</p>
        
            <p>Just like Sia and her iconic face-covering wig, 22-year-old Dylan of Ngāti Kahungunu and Japanese descent only wants people to know him as Rokkō Island, or Rokkō for short.</p>
        
            <p>The alias comes from where he was raised on Rokkō Island, Japan - Mount Rokkō being the tallest mountain of six.</p>
        
            <p>"You can say it's imaginary but to me it's very real, it's a place you can come and feel at peace, to heal, or feel happy, it's a place with no worries or stresses."</p>
        
            <p>When he was 13 his whānau moved to Ōtautahi for a classic kiwi-boy-lifestyle and it's been good ever since, he said.</p>
        
            <p>It was a bit of kiwi summer nostalgia that prompted Rokkō making his own music.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone has that one good summer, and this one summer I was on a road trip to the North Island and the soundtrack of that summer was UB40 Labour of Love.</p>
        
            <p>"The feeling I had, I felt reggae [captured] that whole feeling of happiness and ease and it kind of grabbed my soul. And that feeling I had, I want everyone else to feel that way."</p>
        
            <p>So, he started out in his car, finding tracks on YouTube and jamming with the vibe.</p>

Rokkō went to Los Angeles to build a relationship with a record label. Rokkō says he likes monkeys, but the ones in this picture aren't real.

            <p>"I was a closet artist for years. I only made music maybe once or twice a month - when I wanted to and when I needed to because music to me is quite therapeutic."</p>
        
            <p>He still uses the same method rather than going into a recording studio because he said the car seats act as the sound absorbers that a usual studio would have.</p>
        
            <p>He is most inspired during the early 12am - 3am solitude, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When I make music I do a melody run with a track playing in the background and I usually do it while I'm driving because that's when I get the best sort of inspiration."</p>
        
            <p>"And I came up with the words and melody for AVA in the car while I was driving and I had to pull over straight away in the middle of nowhere, [it was] pitch black, there were fields for days, and I recorded AVA on the spot."</p>
        
            <p>But he never planned on releasing any of his music, not even his inner circle of friends knew about his quiet passion.</p>
        
            <p>It was his reggae-loving friend who was blown away that Rokkō had kept his passion a secret.</p>
        
            <p>"I always wanted to recreate that feeling I had that summer, I always wanted to make healing music, uplifting music because life's already stressful enough.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially in New Zealand, the suicide rates are quite high, even with Māori communities as well, so if my music can get you through the day or uplift you in some way then that's all I want."</p>
        
            <p>He has two-three years worth of songs and demos that "just need a bit of fine tuning", and he aims to write more in time for summer.</p>
        
            <p>"That's what I aim to do is take over summer with reggae."</p>
