            <p>Engineering issues have forced an Air New Zealand plane back to the ground in Christchurch on Sunday evening.</p>
        
            <p>A flight tracking website showed the plane - bound for Hamilton - made it as far north as Blenheim before performing a u-turn.</p>
        
            <p>It landed back in Christchurch before 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>The flight returned due to "engineering", an Air New Zealand spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Customers would be booked on the next available flight to Hamilton.</p>
