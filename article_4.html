        <p>
Rough conditions have made the search efforts challenging, says the Maritime NZ Rescue Coordination Centre.

            <p>The search continues for a fishing boat which was reported missing off the coast of Gisborne on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>A concerned fishing party contacted police just before 4pm, after the boat failed to return from a day trip.</p>
        
            <p>Initially, it was believed there were two people onboard the 7m vessel, Maritime New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre on Tuesday said it had subsequently confirmed three people were onboard.</p>
        
            <p>The last known communication of the missing boat was with another vessel before 10am on Monday, when it was about 20km off shore.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard Gisborne, the Gisborne Rescue Helicopter, and several vessels supported the initial search on Monday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight, a NZDF P8 Poseidon undertook a radar search off Poverty Bay, Northern Hawke's Bay, and the Māhia Peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday morning, a helicopter is searching between Gisborne and the Māhia Peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>The Rescue Coordination Centre said more aircraft would join the search as conditions allowed.</p>
        
            <p>Operation manager Michael Clulow said heavy rain, strong winds and large seas were forecast in the area on Tuesday, making the search challenging.</p>
