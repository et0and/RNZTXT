            <p>Warning - This story discusses suicide.</p>
        
            <p>A man whose skeletal remains were found washed up across two north Canterbury beaches is believed to have been on a drug-fuelled bender in the 24 hours before his death.</p>
        
            <p>The remains of 37-year-old Lewis Gerrard Robertson were found washed up across Amberley and Leithfield beaches on 6 January 2022.</p>
        
            <p>The discovery came nearly a fortnight after the Napier man burgled a Warehouse store in Richmond, near Nelson, where he took $50,000 in cash.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Alexandra Cunninghame released findings into Robertson's death on Thursday, with a definite cause still unexplained.</p>
        
            <p>The inquiry showed Robertson had struggled with methamphetamine use and spoke of suicide to loved ones.</p>
        
            <p>Clues first emerged on Boxing Day 2021 when beachgoers came across $10,000 cash on Amberley Beach.</p>
        
            <p>Cash was also found blowing around several kilometres further south at the neighbouring Leithfield Beach.</p>
        
            <p>In 2016, Robertson met German woman Rebecca Merle.</p>
        
            <p>They married and had a daughter a year later.</p>
        
            <p>Merle was deported to Germany days after the baby was born.</p>
        
            <p>"Lewis desperately wanted to move to Germany to be with them but could not afford to do so," the report said.</p>
        
            <p>Merle told police her husband turned to burglary to raise money, resulting in him being sentenced to imprisonment for about 18 months in September 2019.</p>
        
            <p>"This was not Lewis' first time in prison."</p>
        
            <p>She said Robertson would constantly talk about taking his life when "things were not going his way, if he did not have any money, or was otherwise struggling".</p>
        
            <p>In these phases he would turn to drugs.</p>
        
            <p>By late-2021, Robertson was telling people he had cancer and that he was being pursued by gang members who were going to kill him.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson told his father during a visit that he was planning to travel to Dunedin where he had friends.</p>
        
            <p>His father, who described his son as "frazzled and tired" bought him a bus ticket to Wellington and a flight from there to Dunedin on 15 December.</p>
        
            <p>Once in Wellington, Robertson alerted his father that he could not board the flight because he did not have photo ID.</p>
        
            <p>On 17 December, he was invited to stay with his cousin and partner in Nelson.</p>
        
            <p>His cousin told police that on 23 December, Robertson was acting out-of-character "going on about being chased and shooting at the pigs".</p>
        
            <p>The Warehouse in Richmond was burgled in the early hours of Christmas Eve where Robertson entered the building and stole $50,000 in cash.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson made a beeline south to Christchurch following the burglary after purchasing a Subaru Legacy from a Nelson resident, under the guise of Stefan Te Aho.</p>
        
            <p>He checked into a motel, under the alias, upon arriving in Christchurch that afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Robertson then spent the next 24 hours with a sex worker where he took methamphetamine.</p>
        
            <p>The pair went to Robertson's motel from where he retrieved a shoe box of money which he said was from gambling.</p>
        
            <p>The woman said she saw him count between $10,000-$15,000 in front of her.</p>
        
            <p>On Christmas Day they went to New Brighton Beach where Robertson swam.</p>
        
            <p>She told police he looked as if "he was a strong swimmer".</p>
        
            <p>"Lewis wanted to jump off the New Brighton Pier for fun, but the woman talked him out of it."</p>
        
            <p>Robertson left the woman's house at 4pm that afternoon after rebuffing his suggestion "that she be his girlfriend and come on a road trip with him".</p>
        
            <p>"The woman was clear that she was not interested in this.</p>
        
            <p>"Lewis told her that he was going to try and get some more methamphetamine."</p>
        
            <p>Shortly after 8pm on Christmas Day, Robertson was captured on CCTV at a Christchurch petrol station.</p>
        
            <p>He was again captured driving north to Amberley about an hour later.</p>
        
            <p>Between 9pm and 10.30pm, Robertson and the sex worker exchanged dozens of text messages about money, where she threatened to involve the police for money owed.</p>
        
            <p>She tried calling at about 10.30pm before sending a series of further texts which "were not received by [Robertson's] phone".</p>
        
            <p>Merle, who also had been in touch with Robertson that day, told police she spoke to him at about 10pm.</p>
        
            <p>"Shortly after this Lewis sent her a message saying 'Becci they found me'. He did not answer her messages after this."</p>
        
            <p>Shortly after midnight on 26 December, CCTV captured Robertson driving south through Amberley.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no evidence that Lewis was seen, or captured on CCTV footage, after this time."</p>
        
            <p>Early Boxing Day morning, walkers on Amberley Beach came across cash on the sand.</p>
        
            <p>Near the high tide mark, police found a pair of shoes which were identical to ones worn by Robertson in CCTV footage.</p>
        
            <p>Police found the Subaru Legacy which he had bought in Nelson in the beach carpark.</p>
        
            <p>Forensic pathologist David Taylor performed a post-mortem on Robertson's remains and found minimal evidence of injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Samples for a toxicological analysis also were not possible.</p>
        
            <p>He noted drowning as a possible cause but was unable to conclude it as a definite cause.</p>
        
            <p>The pathologist was asked about the fact Robertson's body decomposed in a matter of days.</p>
        
            <p>Taylor told the inquiry this was "quite normal" for bodies that enter the water off the East Coast of the South Island to be stripped in a very short time by "sea lice, sand lice, and associated small sea creatures".</p>
        
            <p>Cunninghame ruled Robertson died, either "by suicide, or by an accidental drowning or drug overdose".</p>
        
            <p>"While it is not possible to know exactly how Lewis died, I hope that the facts that have been established can assist in obtaining closure."</p>
