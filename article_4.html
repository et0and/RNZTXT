            <p>Police said that on Friday at 4.05pm, they were called to a Massey Street address after reports that a man had been seen with a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>The man was later taken into custody at an armed traffic stop on Cambridge Road.</p>
        
            <p>A search of the vehicle located two firearms and a collection of ammunition.</p>
        
            <p>On arrival at the Hamilton Central Police Station, staff also located an "item of concern" among the man's property.</p>
        
            <p>Police have not said what the item was, but said they took advice from the New Zealand Defence Force to secure the item away from police staff and any public areas of the station.</p>
