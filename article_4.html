            <p>A small fire is burning on a hill above State Highway 2 between Wellington City and the Hutt Valley at Horokiwi north of Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency (FENZ) said firefighters responded to the scrub fire about an hour ago, and there is no threat to life or property from the blaze.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ shift manager Murray Dunbar said they've received plenty of calls about the fire due to its visibility up on the hill, but says it looks worse than it is.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters are already at the scene, with a water tanker arriving shortly, said Dunbar, and he expects the 10 metres by 10 metres burn will be extinguished in "no time".</p>
