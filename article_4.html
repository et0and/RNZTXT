            <p>Tūī numbers in Canterbury have grown exponentially over the past decade, compared to anywhere else in the country.</p>
        
            <p>New figures from the 2023 State of New Zealand Garden Birds report by Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research show there has been more than a 200 percent increase in tūī in Canterbury in the past ten years, compared to a 23 per cent across the rest of the motu.</p>
        
            <p>Senior researcher Dr Angela Brandt said that was not a cause for concern.</p>
        
            <p>"The rate of these increases is generally slowing down, which makes some sense when you think about how percentage increases work. Having four tūī sightings is a 100 percent increase when you started with only two sightings, but seeing six the next year becomes a 50 percent increase."</p>
        
            <p>Canterbury has also seen a rapid increase of both kererū and pīwakawaka in the past 10 years, despite shallow increases nationally.</p>
        
            <p>Some introduced species are increasing, with mynas (maina) continuing their rapid increase in Wellington (126 percent over 10 years) and increasingly in the Manawatū-Whanganui region (30 percent over five years), but numbers showed little to no change nationally.</p>
        
            <p>Sparrow numbers were declining for the first time, while starlings (tāringi) and dunnocks also both showed shallow declines over 10 years.</p>
        
            <p>The declining numbers of some birds should also trigger an alert.</p>
        
            <p>The tauhou (silvereye) has seen a long-term shallow decline nationally shift to a moderate decline in the short term. Goldfinch (kōuraini) and chaffinch counts are showing a rapid decline (30 percent for both species) over five years.</p>
        
            <p>Brandt said the survey was valuable as birds were important indicators of the health of New Zealand's environment, performed important ecosystem functions and had inherent value as taonga species.</p>
        
            <p>Participants were asked in 2023 what more could be done to care for birds in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Of the 3684 people who answered the question, 43 percent mentioned cats in their responses - with some advocating for cats wearing bells on their collars all the way to outright bans.</p>
        
            <p>Garden Bird Survey founder Eric Spurr said he was excited his vision to provide long-term data on New Zealand garden bird trends when establishing the survey almost two decades ago, was now coming to fruition.</p>
        
            <p>He was thrilled that more than 60,000 citizen scientists had taken part since the survey's inception.</p>
        
            <p>"Without these volunteers...none of this data would have been collected."</p>
        
            <p>This year the survey runs from 29 June - 7 July, with bird identification information on the New Zealand Garden Bird Survey website.</p>
