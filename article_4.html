        <h2>Survivors doubt mental health system can step up</h2>
        <p>
People who have suffered acute mental breakdowns fear the health system will not be ready to fill the gap when police withdraw from crisis callouts.

The police department proposed a managed withdrawal from what it considered non-crime social problems, Police Minister Mark Mitchell has said.

            <p>People who have suffered acute mental breakdowns fear the health system will not be ready to fill the gap when police withdraw from crisis callouts.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand Te Whatu Ora said it was working with police on plans to move to "a multi-agency response" to mental distress.</p>
        
            <p>Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey has also floated the idea of having a specific mental health option when people call 111.</p>
        
            <p>Vee is among those who are sceptical that such a plan will be adequately resourced.</p>
        
            <p>A 40-something professional with a young family, she has experienced multiple episodes of mental distress since she was a teenager, which often result in someone calling 111 and police attending.</p>
        
            <p>"I've been restrained by police, I've been handcuffed, I've been manhandled into a car, I've been held in a cell.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm a person who's quite successful, if you met me on the street you wouldn't know any of those things about me. But those experiences are quite terrifying.</p>
        
            <p>"And to be treated in such a way, which really doesn't do anything to advance recovery or bring about recovery, is just not OK."</p>
        
            <p>This was not primarily the fault of police - it was the failure of mental health services, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not a new thing. I remember being 16 years old and the CAT [crisis assessment and treatment] team not being available. We're talking about years and years and years of underfunding. So where are they now? I don't know. But I don't believe they were there before either.</p>
        
            <p>"Te Whatu Ora is continually pushing things back to police, [but] that's not their job."</p>
        
            <p>Vee said she believed it was "possible" to turn it around.</p>
        
            <p>"But it's not enough to direct people in mental distress to some website, or give them a crisis line to text....</p>
        
            <p>"They need to come to the party with money. And for Te Whatu Ora to come to the party with money, we need the government to come to the party with money."</p>
        
            <p>BJ, who is also in his 40s, started suffering extreme anxiety, impulsive behaviour, angry outbursts and suicidal thoughts four years ago - but had to wait more than three years to start treatment.</p>
        
            <p>"When there's no treatment available, or treatment is delayed, you're kind of in a holding pattern as your health declines, you're waiting, you're just waiting for the phone call that says 'Yes, we can get you treatment now'. And you're like 'Yes, I'm going to learn new things, I'm going to get back to normal'."</p>
        
            <p>However, getting "back to normal" has got more difficult for BJ following a run-in with police in October.</p>
        
            <p>During a violent argument with his wife, he called 111 pleading for help - but ended up assaulting her before police arrived.</p>
        
            <p>"No-one's really listening to what's going on, I'm not in my right mind. For the most part I am, but when I'm in extreme circumstances, my reactions are beyond extreme.</p>
        
            <p>"My behaviour is beyond what's even reasonable."</p>
        
            <p>BJ pleaded guilty to assault and is awaiting sentencing next month.</p>
        
            <p>However, he believed the protracted criminal justice process - which had been traumatic for him, his wife and family - could have been avoided if he had been able to get the health care he needed.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, the only medical option was being "sectioned" - assessed under the Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act, which would be the first step to making a plea of not guilty due to insanity.</p>
        
            <p>BJ was not insane, so that was not an option.</p>
        
            <p>"There needs to be an element of compassion, not a punitive approach, to this sort of thing."</p>
        
            <p>Last year, police attended 77,000 call-outs involving people in mental distress, or threatening suicide - of which only 4 to 5 percent involved criminal behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>Mental Health Foundation chief executive Shaun Robinson said the fact that police were responding to mental distress was a symptom of a system that was sick.</p>
        
            <p>"One of the things that's been really infuriating in the last few years has been the lack of a plan, an overall plan for staffing across our whole response to mental health health."</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand Te Whatu Ora declined an interview.</p>
        
            <p>However, in a written statement, specialist mental health and addiction director Karla Bergquist conceded there was "significant pressure and demand".</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand was not alone in dealing with long-standing workforce shortages - but those with acute mental health needs would always get priority treatment, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Crisis teams use evidence-based tools to assess the level of response required.</p>
        
            <p>"This means people with the most acute needs are seen first and unfortunately may result in some people having to wait to access services.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to acknowledge how difficult it would be for someone in distress being unable to access our crisis services.</p>
        
            <p>"If there is an immediate threat to someone's safety, police may be contacted."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, joint work was underway with police to explore options, and plan the transition to a multi-agency response for those in mental distress.</p>
        
            <p>One option was to extend the co-response teams, which involved mental health specialists working alongside police.</p>
