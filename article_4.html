            <p>Hundreds of homes throughout the North Island are still without power after extensive damage caused by storms on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>Falling trees damaged powerlines and lightning strikes blew fuses throughout the network.</p>
        
            <p>Powerco, which supplies electricity to the Coromandel, Taranaki and Manawatu-Whanganui, said almost 4000 households lost power last night.</p>
        
            <p>The company had restored electricity to more than 3000 properties but said customers in Wairarapa, Western Bay of Plenty and parts of New Plymouth were still cut off.</p>
        
            <p>Almost 300 homes in Masterton were still without power after a lightning strike last night, and a fallen tree had caused about 150 properties in New Plymouth's Westown and Frankleigh Park to lose power this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>More than a 100 rural properties dotted around the North Island also remained without power.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the power lines company Vector said there were outages in Snells Beach and Waimauku in Auckland as a result of Saturday's weather, impacting about 200 customers.</p>
        
            <p>They said crews were onsite and all customers were expected to have their power back on later today.</p>
        
            <p>In Hamilton, 600 properties were without power early on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Strong wind watches that MetService had in place for Taup≈ç, Taihape, inland Hastings District and Central Hawke's Bay District earlier today are no longer in force, however a strong wind watch remains in place for Fiordland and Southland, including Stewart Island, until 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain watch for Fiordland is also due to take effect from 5pm and into the early hours of Monday.</p>
