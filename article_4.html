        <h2>Workers don't have legal rights to tips - employment laywer</h2>
        <p>
Tips left for staff members legally belong to their employer because the country doesn't have any legislation that says otherwise, an employment lawyer says. Audio

            <p>Who has legal dibs on the tip jar, whether it's cold hard cash or the electronic kind?</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has recently reported on the rise of a new eftpos machine that asks customers for tips and it has raised questions about who is in control of the money - and who gets it.</p>
        
            <p>Employment lawyer Barbara Buckett told Checkpoint that tips belong to the employer and are counted as business income.</p>
        
            <p>"Unlike other countries, we don't have any legislation that says otherwise. If you're in the States or the UK, there is legislation that ring-fences the allocation of these payments," Buckett said.</p>
        
            <p>She said it was a myth that employees themselves receive the tips but because it goes to the employer, it would be taxed.</p>
        
            <p>Buckett said tips could make a lot of difference for people.</p>
        
            <p>"It's no wonder that it's generating a lot of interest because ... [tips] can add up to something like $100 a week for some people, particularly for doing Friday or Saturday nights.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not a small amount in the scheme of things."</p>
        
            <p>Buckett said that with a rise of electronic tipping, New Zealand law may need to change.</p>
        
            <p>"The UK and the States ... have always had more of a practice and more of an understanding of tipping which is very, very foreign to us in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>She said legislation may need to line up with law overseas, such as payments such as tips being ring-fenced. Another way was to have something in the contract.</p>
        
            <p>"I think what's needed here is some clear understanding as to what the nature of those payments are and how they will be allocated."</p>
