            <p>A Dunedin man in his 60s is behind bars after police and Customs teamed up for a drug raid in Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>Operation Rubus, an investigation into controlled drug offending within the Southern District, saw officials execute a search warrant. They found two firearms, ammunition, controlled drugs, controlled drug utensils, stun guns and cash.</p>
        
            <p>A 67-year-old man was arrested and charged with two counts of unlawful possession of a firearm, three of unlawful possession of a restricted weapon, two of failing to provide the passcode to a cell phone and driving while licence suspended.</p>
        
            <p>After his first appearance in Dunedin District Court, he was remanded in custody. His next court appearance will be on 26 March.</p>
        
            <p>"Controlled drug distribution continues to have a significant negative impact on families in our communities," Detective Senior Sergeant Nik Leigh said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Those involved in controlled drug distribution will continue to be targeted by police."</p>
