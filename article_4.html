            <p>Police said after failing to stop on the Northwestern Motorway for having mismatching plates, the man was apprehended at Dress Smart shopping centre in Onehunga.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland City road policing manager Acting Inspector Scott Jones said the man was driving a stolen vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>"It's fortunate that neither the public nor police staff suffered any injuries as a result of the man's alleged actions."</p>
        
            <p>The man faced charges of aggravated assault, reckless driving, failing to stop, and unlawfully taking a motor vehicle.</p>
