            <p>Crew and passengers who were on board the HMNZS Manawanui when it grounded on a reef in Samoa are arriving back in Auckland tonight aboard an air force C-130 Hercules.</p>
        
            <p>Seventy-five people were rescued from the $100 million specialist survey ship which hit a reef at the southern end of Upolu on Saturday night and sank Sunday morning.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday evening, the RNZAF C-130J flew to Apia carrying medical and welfare personnel, as well as a dive team and light clean-up equipment, the RNZAF said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday night 72 crew and passengers are arriving at RNZAF Base Auckland where they will spend the night at Defence facilities.</p>
        
            <p>They will have further debriefings and be re-united with their families on Tuesday, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>Three passengers from other agencies who were on board the vessel will return to New Zealand on Tuesday via a commercial flight.</p>
        
            <p>A second C-130H Hercules aircraft which took freight to Samoa this morning is also returning to New Zealand today.</p>
        
            <p>A Court of Inquiry into the incident is being set up, the statement said.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Chief of Navy, Rear Admiral Garin Golding said the New Zealand Defence Force was supporting personnel by making available medical checks, debriefings, psychological support and welfare. Some people had required medical treatment, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand response was focused on supporting the Samoan government to understand possible environmental impacts from the incident and reduce those as much as possible, with teams from across multiple agencies involved, he said.</p>
