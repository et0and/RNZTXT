            <p>More than 60 science roles are being cut in a sweeping Massey University restructure condemned by a union as "completely unnecessary".</p>
        
            <p>Staff at Massey's College of Sciences were today told the university would go ahead with a cost-cutting revamp that would merge two schools and consolidate a range of activities at the university's ManawatÅ« campus.</p>
        
            <p>That included research and teaching in disciplines including food technology, chemistry, zoology, ecology, conservation and molecular cell biology - much of which has been based out of Albany.</p>
        
            <p>Massey's engineering, supply chain management and quality systems qualifications, meanwhile, would be closed altogether, with no enrolments from next year.</p>
        
            <p>The changes also spelt the disestablishment of about 67 positions, with newly created roles bringing net cuts to around 56 jobs.</p>
        
            <p>Albany-based ecologist Professor Dianne Brunton, among those given their notice today, said her colleagues were shocked at the decision.</p>
        
            <p>"We thought they might enable a time of teaching out, so we can finish our masters and PhD students, but no, they don't want to do that," said Brunton, who now expects to leave in April.</p>
        
            <p>The college's pro-vice chancellor, Professor Ray Geor, said all current students would be assisted in completing their qualifications, either through teach-out of the qualification, or transferring within Massey or to another institution.</p>
        
            <p>Geor said the changes would allow the college to build on its teaching and research, while also addressing "challenging financial circumstances".</p>
        
            <p>The cash-strapped university reportedly faced a potential operating deficit of more than $50 million for 2023 - much higher than the $8.8m deficit it posted in 2022.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge this will be a challenging time for staff and are providing support to those impacted," Geor said.</p>
        
            <p>The decision follows months of often-tense negotiations between university leadership, affected staff and union delegates, who last month tried to avert job losses with an alternative proposal that was ultimately rejected.</p>
        
            <p>Tertiary Education Union organiser Ben Schmidt said today's outcome was "deeply disappointing" for members.</p>
        
            <p>"They are hard-working and crucial parts of the university and science community, and this is completely unnecessary, short-sighted and the wrong decision to make," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The next step for us is meeting and talking with members who are affected by this."</p>
        
            <p>The restructure is the latest in rolling rounds of cuts across New Zealand universities, in which hundreds of jobs have been eliminated through voluntary or forced redundancies.</p>
        
            <p>While the Covid-19 pandemic worsened universities' financial woes, Universities New Zealand has pointed to a steady decline in real-term government funding over the past decade.</p>
