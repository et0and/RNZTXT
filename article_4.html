            <p>Six people have been arrested after a street racing meet in Wairarapa turned violent overnight with a group hurling bottles, rocks and fireworks at police officers.</p>
        
            <p>Police say they broke up the planned activity by what they call anti-social road users on Waingawa Road near Masterton just after 1am.</p>
        
            <p>Officers were confronted by an aggressive group who threw things at them and smashed the back window of a police car.</p>
        
            <p>Police say they arrested six people who face a range of charges.</p>
        
            <p>They also issued multiple infringement notices, suspended some drivers, and impounded two cars.</p>
        
            <p>Masterton mayor Gary Caffell hoped it was a one-off, and told RNZ it was disappointing.</p>
        
            <p>"We pride ourselves on the fact that we welcome people into Masterton. ... We're a very friendly town and this sort of behaviour, it just ... it really guts you when you hear about it."</p>
        
            <p>Caffell said police officers were just trying to do their jobs and uphold the law, and should not be subjected to that kind of behaviour.</p>
