            <p>Passengers crossing Cook Strait are being warned rough seas could once again make the journey tough going.</p>
        
            <p>A run of southerlies has led to delays and cancellations in recent days, although trips are going ahead on both Interislander and Bluebridge ferries on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Bluebridge said while the huge swells were starting to ease sailings might still take longer than normal - with delays to some services - and be uncomfortable.</p>
        
            <p>Passengers on affected sailings have been contacted.</p>
        
            <p>"We appreciate that a lot of people are travelling with us over the holidays, and we are sorry that these weather-related disruptions may impact your travel plans," the ferry said on its website.</p>
        
            <p>"Our top priority is ensuring everyone's safety while minimising the impact on our customers."</p>
        
            <p>Some Interislander ferries were cancelled on Sunday but services are running as usual today.</p>
        
            <p>It said the large swells in the strait should start to ease tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>It recommended sitting towards the rear of the ship where there was less ship movement, not sailing on an empty stomach, sipping ginger ale during the trip, and trying seasickness pills.</p>
