            <p>Immersed in the darker side of life - including partying on Epstein's Island - New Zealander Alysha Hanin disappeared in Miami Beach in 2002. She left behind a young son, who is now on a mission to find out what happened. Katie Ham investigates.</p>
        
            <p>A cold case involving a Kiwi woman who disappeared under mysterious circumstances in the United States more than two decades ago has been reignited by the Florida police.</p>
        
            <p>Alysha Hanin, who was just 24 years old when she went missing, lived a fast life of drugs and partying on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's island before she vanished after leaving a luxury Miami hotel in the middle of the night in 2002.</p>
        
            <p>Hanin left behind a then three-year-old son, Adrian Hoffmann, who has now begun his own search for answers in the case local police suspect involved "foul play".</p>
        
            <p>"She was a very sweet, smart girl who got caught in a bad circle, but that doesn't mean she doesn't deserve justice," Auckland based Hoffmann told Stuff.</p>
        
            <p>The case resurfaced when the Florida Department of Law Enforcement posted Hanin's profile on their social media as part of their '#MissingMonday' series earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>Hoffmann was contacted by the Miami Herald, prompting him to think back to 2002.</p>
        
            <p>On 6 January 2002, Hanin - known to family in New Zealand as Krsangi - was seen leaving the luxury hotel Shore Club in south Miami Beach at approximately 4am.</p>
        
            <p>She never returned to the hotel and no-one has heard from her since.</p>
        
            <p>Her passport, luggage, purse, ID and credit cards were found inside the hotel room.</p>
        
            <p>Known to travel between LA, California and Miami on a monthly basis, there has been no activity on any of Hanin's bank cards since the day she was last seen.</p>

            <p>According to the Miami Beach Police Department, "foul play is suspected" to have played a role in her disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>Hoffmann was just 3 years old when his mother went missing, leaving behind her a trail of unanswered questions and blurred memories.</p>
        
            <p>Now a year older than his mother was when she went missing, Hoffmann has decided to speak publicly about his mother for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>"My hope is to shed a little bit more light on what happened to her, to just find out that little bit more.</p>

            <p>"There are a lot of little pathways that I have a gut feeling will end up connecting," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Although Hanin's case received little media coverage in New Zealand at the time she went missing, it did attract the attention of a private investigator who travelled with Hanin's mother to Miami Beach in the weeks following her disappearance.</p>
        
            <p>Having recently been contacted by Hoffmann, private investigator and ex-police detective, Michael Campbell, told Stuff he conducted "extensive inquiries" with Hanin's family at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"This was a tragic series of events, which involved a beautiful young life and there's no reason why this case couldn't be solved," Campbell said.</p>
        
            <p>
As Hanin's son, Adrian Hoffmann, has grown older, he has learnt that she was a "very sweet, smart girl who got caught in a bad circle".

</p>
        
            <p>Describing a life littered with tragedy, Hoffmann told Stuff that his mother had been born in India but had spent her life travelling as part of the Hare Krishna community.</p>
        
            <p>When Hoffmann was just four months old, his father died, leaving Hanin to raise him alone.</p>
        
            <p>With Hanin's mother - Hoffmann's grandmother - living in New Zealand, Aotearoa was always a base for her as she continued to travel the world, sometimes with Hoffmann and sometimes without.</p>
        
            <p>By the early 2000s, Hanin's life had begun to spiral, with drug use and work as an escort becoming more regular, Hoffmann understands.</p>
        
            <p>
Hanin is described by police as a a caucasian female, between 5'6 and 5'7, and approximately 120 pounds, with blonde hair and blue eyes.

            <p>Hanin also told her loved ones she would be invited with friends to party on Epstein's Island, Hoffmann said.</p>
        
            <p>"It seems like she was sucked into this from a mostly innocent start - partying, drugs and money are common - but if you go down that rabbit hole with the wrong people, you can end up not being able to get out," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Weeks before her mysterious disappearance, Hanin returned to Aotearoa to drop Hoffmann with his grandmother, and said she was returning to Miami Beach to "tie up some loose ends".</p>
        
            <p>She told Hoffmann's grandmother that she wanted to leave the life she was leading in Miami behind and raise her son here, Hoffmann understands.</p>
        
            <p>
No one has seen or heard from Hanin since she disappeared in 2002.

            <p>This is the last time she was seen by her family.</p>
        
            <p>Hanin is described by the Miami Beach Police Department as a caucasian female, between 5'6 and 5'7, and approximately 120 pounds, with blonde hair and blue eyes.</p>
        
            <p>She has ear piercings and a piercing on her left nostril, as well as a scar on the pad of her right index finger.</p>
        
            <p>Hanin is known to have gone by the first names Alysha, Krsangi and Yami, and the surnames Hanin, Senk and Devi.</p>
