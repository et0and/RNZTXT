            <p>Flushed underwear is causing a big stink in Central Otago, where it has cost the district council more than $3600 since May 2023.</p>
        
            <p>There have been 11 blockages involving underwear at the Eureka Street wastewater pump station in Alexandra during that period.</p>
        
            <p>The council said it was usually children's underwear sizes six to 12.</p>
        
            <p>Parents and caregivers were urged to talk to their children about what could and couldn't be flushed.</p>
        
            <p>It had cost $3669.37 to clear the blockages since last May, but that did not factor in this week's underwear flushing, the council said in a post on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>It released a map showing the rough area the culprits were in, and said caregivers should remind their children that only pee, poo and toilet paper could be flushed.</p>
        
            <p>"Blockages caused by incorrectly flushing wet wipes, sanitary items and putting cooking fats and oils down the kitchen drain all contribute to elevated operational cost to the community."</p>
