            <p>Volunteers involved in a search and rescue exercise on Saturday were given a taste of the real thing when a group of kayakers got into trouble.</p>
        
            <p>The three kayakers were blown offshore by strong wind and sea conditions at Whangamatā on the Coromandel Peninsula.</p>
        
            <p>A paddleboarder who was among the group made it safely to shore.</p>
        
            <p>However, the Whangamatā Volunteer Coastguard found one kayaker off Whangamatā and the others in the water at Onemana, around 8km away.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard unit support manager Murray Whitehead said a number of Coastguard volunteers, Surf Life Saving and police "assets" were in the area taking part in a planned search and rescue exercise.</p>
        
            <p>The kayakers were retrieved "in good health" and taken to Coastguard Whangamatā's base for hot drinks, food and showers.</p>
        
            <p>"This fantastic result highlights the value of Coastguard volunteers and other first responders coming together to train and enhance their search and rescue capabilities ahead of summer," Whitehead said.</p>
        
            <p>The kayakers were were well-prepared for the conditions and were wearing wetsuits and lifejackets, he said.</p>
