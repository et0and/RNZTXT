            <p>The rollout of a national bowel cancer screening programme appears to have stalled - much to the concern of a support charity.</p>
        
            <p>Two years ago, the Labour government announced $36 million of funding to bring the starting age for bowel screening for Māori and Pasifika people down to 50, from the previous starting age of 60.</p>
        
            <p>The programme was to be trialled in selected regions in the latter half of 2022 with a more extensive rollout from July 2023.</p>
        
            <p>But more than 18 months later, just three regional health authorities - Te Whatu Ora Waikato, Te Whatu Ora Tairāwhiti, and Te Whatu Ora Midcentral - are the only regional health authorities inviting Māori and Pasifika to be screened from the age of 50.</p>
        
            <p>Bowel Cancer New Zealand medical adviser Professor Sue Crengle said that was concerning, as a higher proportion of Māori developed bowel cancer before they reached 60 (21 percent of cases) than non-Māori (10 percent of cases).</p>
        
            <p>The figures were similar for Pacific peoples, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Bowel Cancer New Zealand wants to know whether Te Whatu Ora plans to complete this rollout urgently or whether it was just a token effort in three regions.</p>
        
            <p>"Action is needed as far too many Māori and Pasifika are dying that could have a fighting chance if they were screened from 50.</p>
        
            <p>"A clear timeline and accountability is needed from Health New Zealand to prevent this health inequity from continuing."</p>
        
            <p>Crengle said it was "pleasing" to learn the National Bowel Screening Programme had distributed more than two million home-screening kits across Aotearoa, picking up 2495 cancers.</p>
        
            <p>Health Minister Shane Reti told RNZ in a statement that the $36 million to lower the bowel screening age for Māori and Pacific peoples "was allocated by the previous government through Budget 2022".</p>
        
            <p>The policy was still being evaluated, he added.</p>
        
            <p>"This government remains committed to lowering the bowel screening age for all New Zealanders, as we indicated during the campaign. I expect to see advice in the coming months as to how this could be achieved."</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora's director of prevention Alana Ewe-Snow said the national rollout of the bowel screening age extension for all districts required ministerial approval.</p>
        
            <p>"This did not gain ministerial approval before the 2023 election. The tentative project timeline that was shared regarding the rollout is now outdated."</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand was working with partner agencies to provide advice in the coming months on the age extension for the bowel screening programme across the country, she said.</p>
        
            <p>But Crengle said the evidence was already clear.</p>
        
            <p>"If bowel cancer screening for Māori started from 50, more whānau would be prevented from having to go through the distress associated with an advanced diagnosis."</p>
