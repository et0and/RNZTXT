        <h2>24% rates hikes proposed for Napier</h2>
        <p>
The proposed hike would come despite a promise there will be no new major projects except cyclone preparation.

            <p>Napier homeowners are facing a rates hike of 23.7 percent this year.</p>
        
            <p>The proposed rates increase is part of Napier City Council's three-year plan, and includes a portion dedicated to improving resilience in the aftermath of Cyclone Gabrielle.</p>
        
            <p>The plan was about "getting the basics right", mayor Kirsten Wise said, adding that there were no new projects planned apart from those that would improve resilience.</p>
        
            <p>"Recovery still requires significant resourcing, but at the same time, we need to stay focused on the core services our community wants and needs from us," she said.</p>
        
            <p>That included investing in infrastructure and dealing with escalating materials and labour costs.</p>
        
            <p>"We can't shy away from these challenges, including increasing costs," Wise said.</p>
        
            <p>"If we don't face them now, we will be creating an untenable situation for future generations."</p>
        
            <p>The draft plan will open for consultation on Monday, 25 March.</p>
        
            <p>Council wants to hear people's views on six key areas: council-owned housing, improving resilience, how council investments are managed, increases to fees and charges, the funding of some tourism facilities and the future of council office accommodation.</p>
        
            <p>In the aftermath of Cyclone Gabrielle, central government gave the council dispensation to prepare a three-year plan focused on cyclone recovery, rather than the usual 10-year long-term plan.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Napier City Council also plans to sell off its social housing in favour of retirement flats.</p>
        
            <p>Keeping the housing as is would mean a 2.6 percent rates increase every year, it said in February.</p>
