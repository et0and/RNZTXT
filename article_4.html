            <p>A legal bid by the Jehovah's Witness church challenging a ruling by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care has been dismissed by the Court of Appeal.</p>
        
            <p>In March, the church appealed a High Court ruling that dismissed its claim to be excluded from the investigation.</p>
        
            <p>On appeal, it disputed the decison to broaden the scope of the inquiry from institutional care to trust based relationships saying that was done to target the faith.</p>
        
            <p>The Jehovah's Witness church maintains it should be exempt because it did not run institutions that cared for children or vulnerable people.</p>
        
            <p>Justice Cooke said the court did not accept those arguments and has dismissed the appeal.</p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
