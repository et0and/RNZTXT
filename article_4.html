            <p>The cost of school uniforms is an age old problem with some kits topping $1000 but in the current economy it is more difficult than ever, an Otago University researcher says.</p>
        
            <p>With the start of the school year fast approaching, there are calls for a rethink to the complexity of school uniforms.</p>
        
            <p>Lecturer in Public health at the University of Otago, Johanna Reidy, told Morning Report that uniforms should encourage school attendance, not be a barrier.</p>
        
            <p>"When we are thinking about school uniforms, it's worth taking a step back and thinking about why they were instituted in the first place, and that was to make access to education easier for students who generally didn't have much.</p>
        
            <p>"But when you start to have the cost of uniforms stopping kids getting to school, we need to think about what we can do to step in."</p>
        
            <p>Reidy said the research she had been involved with on the impact of uniforms on education and health had shown there was a place for school uniforms, but they needed to be less complex as a way of reducing cost.</p>
        
            <p>"The more broad research I've been doing into the impact of uniform on education and health shows that when we are looking globally at most studies, there is a place for school uniforms, easy school uniforms though.</p>
        
            <p>"It can be a very simple one that helps reduce distractions and helps students settle to task."</p>
        
            <p>Reidy said that schools in New Zealand were run by the local communities who made the decisions about uniforms.</p>
        
            <p>"One thing that communities could do is use the tools that they've got, make sure they get a good deal from their suppliers, have a conversation within the community about whether the uniform has to be as complicated as it is, just to bring that price down to something that is more manageable."</p>
        
            <p>The government could step in to help low income families cover the costs of uniforms, Reidy said.</p>
