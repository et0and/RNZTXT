            <p>One of three men jailed earlier this year for the killing of a South Auckland grandmother has successfully appealed his sentence.</p>
        
            <p>Meliame Fisi'ihoi, 57, was shot dead at point-blank range in her home on Calthorp Close in Mangere four years ago, when she answered a knock at her window.</p>
        
            <p>The three men jailed for her death were targeting her son, Stephen Fisi'ihoi, who was not home at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Brothers Viliami and Falala Iongi were convicted of murder in the High Court at Auckland, and sentenced earlier this year, along with their cousin, Manu Iongi, who was found guilty of manslaughter.</p>
        
            <p>The trio were members of a sub-group of the Crips gang, with Falala and Stephen Fisi'ihoi being friends at one point.</p>
        
            <p>In 2019, the relationship broke down over a dispute between the men involving the exchange of methamphetamine for a shotgun.</p>
        
            <p>By December of that year, the dispute had escalated, and at about 9.30pm one evening, Falala and Viliami arrived at the Mangere address, armed with guns.</p>
        
            <p>Shots were fired towards Stephen Fisi'ihoi and the associates he was with at the time, hitting one of them.</p>
        
            <p>A month later, Falala and Viliami, along with Manu Iongi, returned to the Calthorp Close address, and shot Meliame Fisi'ihoi in the head at a range of less than two metres.</p>
        
            <p>Neighbours said they hear a car driving slowly into the street a short time after 2.30am, and driving off at speed after the shooting.</p>
        
            <p>Viliami Iongi was jailed for life with a non-parole period of 15 years, while Falala received the same, with a non-parole period of seven years.</p>
        
            <p>Manu Iongi had originally been charged with murder also, but was sentenced to eight years and six months for manslaughter.</p>
        
            <p>Manu Iongi appealed both his conviction and sentence, while and Falala Iongi appealed his sentence only.</p>
        
            <p>Both men argued their sentences were manifestly excessive.</p>
        
            <p>Viliami Iongi did not appeal.</p>
        
            <p>Manu Iongi appealed his conviction on the grounds that the jury's verdict was unreasonable, and the at the presiding justice failed to adequately summarise his case when summing up.</p>
        
            <p>He also argued the High Court and made a mistake in ruling evidence from another cousin as admissible.</p>
        
            <p>The courts dismissed Manu Iongi's appeal, but granted Falala's, reducing his minimum period of imprisonment from 17 to 15 years.</p>
