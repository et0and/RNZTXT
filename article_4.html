            <p>The rate of homicides in the country has almost doubled over the past three weeks, with police saying they have started eight separate investigations since 16 December.</p>
        
            <p>The police's latest annual homicide report shows that, between 2007 and 2020, New Zealand has averaged one murder or manslaughter every five days, not counting the Christchurch mosque shootings.</p>
        
            <p>Yet over the past 21 days there have been eight homicide probes.</p>
        
            <p>They include the fatal shooting of a Lower Hutt man at a birthday party at his home in mid-December, a Manurewa teenager killed on New Year's Day and that of a 38-year-old male found dead in a Christchurch street on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>They are also looking into two other deaths in Auckland, two in Hamilton and one in Hastings.</p>
        
            <p>The Police Association Te Aka HƒÅpai said the dramatic increase in homicides over Christmas and New Year was unheard of.</p>
        
            <p>Vice president Steve Watt said it was something he had not seen in his 23-year career.</p>
        
            <p>He said stress may have played a part in some of the cases.</p>
        
            <p>"The pressures that comes on families around this holiday period certainly plays a factor in the increase in violence, and the jobs that we're attending.</p>
        
            <p>"It culminates over a whole year of pressure, and tends to have that explosive element to it at this time of year."</p>

            <p>Senior Sergeant Watt said the spike in homicides was also putting extra pressure on staff, with the holiday period already a busy time.</p>
        
            <p>"With the amount of homicides we have been having, alongside our business-as-usual jobs that we have to deal with, there's an increase in demand from the public... and that just adds to the relentless pressure that the members are under."</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said it was difficult to attribute patterns or trends in homicides - "even when it may appear there has been a 'spike' or 'cluster'" - because each case "has unique circumstances".</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson added: "Each of these deaths is tragic and will have far-reaching and devastating impacts for the victims' families and loved ones.</p>
        
            <p>"These deaths are all the subject of extensive investigations, or are already before the courts."</p>
