            <p>More than 4000 pest control traps have been set as part of the Halo Project, which protects wildlife and habitat around the Orokonui Ecosanctuary in Otago by controlling possums, weasels, stoats and rats. Now a new trap system, driven by AI, is being rolled out as a pilot for the project, with 100 traps already on the ground. When an animal or bird approaches the trap, a camera takes a series of images, which AI then assigns a probability score of being a target species, meaning a certain score will arm the trap and catch the pest. The Halo Project also works to restore waterways and wetlands, with 240,000 natives planted thanks to local volunteers.</p>

            <p>For two years, Maria and David Hancock - owners of the historic Eltham Hotel in south Taranaki - have been baking gingernut biscuits to raise funds for the charity Relief Aid, which provides aid to people living in war zones. Last year they raised $3000 for the Ukraine. The idea was inspired by Taranaki local Helena Barnard, who baked four-and-a half tonnes of gingernuts for Kiwi soldiers fighting in the two world wars. Hancock cookies have found their way to people in the Ukraine, with one recipient breaking down in tears, overwhelmed by the kindness of people on the other side of the world.</p>

            <p>Seddonville volunteer firefighter Ian Mulholland was heading home from work in Westport at about 6.15pm when he saw flames coming from the local pub. He checked people weren't in the building and called 111. By the time the fire trucks arrived on site, the fire was almost out thanks to quick thinking from the community. "Our industrious locals actually got bottles of beer... actually opening bottles of beer, shaking them, and putting the fire out." Hotel manager Dean White said the "poor bugger" grabbing the beers from the chiller looked "a bit sad" when a beer was emptied out but the sacrifice saved the pub.</p>

            <p>With velvety smooth custard, hand-piped icing and a healthy dollop of passion-fruit, Piccolo Morso's custard squares were awarded first equal at the Custard Square Championship. Co-owner Julia Kaur-Randhawa bought the bakery with her husband Kamal Singh three years ago, when their first child was only three months old. Julia - a third-generation baker - had completed her apprenticeship at the bakery, and says it's the little things that make a difference to the square. "We've been selling out of two weeks of custard squares before lunch every day the last four days."</p>

            <p>Avatars Global, a small Kiwi tech company, is working on an app it hopes could act as a digital mentor for children and encourage them to get outdoors. In the app, children can pick a character and interact with it, with the child completing challenges such as going for a walk, or picking up a bag of rubbish to receive in-game digital rewards. Co-founder Riley Malins said the characters are like "reverse Tamagotchi". "Your virtual character is checking in with you, asking you about your goals that you've set...really just acting as a mix of a friend, counsellor and coach for children."</p>

            <p>Otago resident Patrick Gallagher had Thursdays off work and decided to see what the waves were up to that morning. He wanted to check the swell in the hope of getting out for a surf, so while having a cup of tea he went online to look at webcam footage of Taieri Mouth. On the camera, he saw something that looked like a beached whale, and did a double take. He rang DOC to report his sighting. Because of how quickly this animal was found, and how fresh it was, the first dissection of the species would now be able to happen.</p>
