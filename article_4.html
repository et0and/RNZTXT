            <p>An invasive fish species has been detected in Kāpiti Coast District's local lakes.</p>
        
            <p>Tench has recently been detected in Kotuku Lake and Waterstone Lake in Paraparaumu.</p>
        
            <p>Council environment and ecological services team lead Andy McKay said the discovery of dead tench suggested fish had been illegally released.</p>
        
            <p>"These fish are new in these waterways and have been released on purpose," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Tench are an introduced fish which can grow to up to 2kg and 70cm in length in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>McKay said they were usually released as a sports fish, however, they were an invasive species which could impact native freshwater communities.</p>
        
            <p>"It's disappointing that people have released fish for their own entertainment and are disregarding the effects new fish species can have on freshwater ecosystems," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd like to remind everyone that the unauthorised introduction of fish into our waterways is prohibited so we can protect biodiversity in our aquatic environments.</p>
        
            <p>"Transporting and releasing fish can attract enforcement penalties under the Conservation Act.</p>
        
            <p>"Fishing in reserves without permission, regardless of the target species, is also prohibited under the Public Places Bylaw."</p>
        
            <p>Kāpiti Coast District Council asks people to report if they see anyone actively fishing or sightings of pest fish through the Antenno app, by calling 0800 486 486, emailing kapiti.council@kapiticoast.govt.nz or making an online service request via the council website.</p>
