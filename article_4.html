            <p>Police hold grave concerns for three missing climbers on Aoraki Mount Cook.</p>
        
            <p>The climbers, attempting to reach the mountain summit, didn't meet their prearranged transport on Monday morning and were reported missing.</p>
        
            <p>A helicopter and search and rescue teams were unable to find the group that afternoon before bad weather halted the search. It is on hold until at least Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>The climbers have been named as 56-year-old Kurt Blair, 50-year-old Carlos Romero from the United States, and a Canadian national.</p>
        
            <p>Aoraki area commander Inspector Vicki Walker told Morning Report searchers spoke to a party coming down the ridge who said the climbers were going up the route and intending to get to the summit.</p>
        
            <p>Walker could not confirm a report that the men had suffered a fatal fall, but said police had "grave concerns" for the missing party.</p>
        
            <p>Search teams on Monday had found an ice axe and a jacket belonging to the party, who were believed to be ascending via the Zurbriggen Ridge.</p>
        
            <p>Walker said searchers spoke to a party coming down the ridge, who said the climbers were going up the route and intending to get to the summit.</p>
        
            <p>Mountain Safety Council chief executive Mike Daisley said the climbing conditions were good at the time the party was expecting to attempt the summit.</p>
        
            <p>The poor weather had come in after they were due out of the area.</p>
        
            <p>Daisley said common hazards on Aoraki Mount Cook were avalanches, glacial crossings, and rockfalls, and there were often icy surface conditions this time of year.</p>
        
            <p>The weather had deteriorated significantly since the weekend, but no avalanches had been reported in the area, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a real tragedy, what looks to be unfolding," he said.</p>
        
            <p>However there had been many examples of experienced climbers such as these surviving by finding snow caves or other shelter.</p>
        
            <p>"Not all hope is lost."</p>
