            <p>Firefighters are tackling a large bush fire which started on Friday night near Whangapē Harbour in the Far North.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency were alerted about 8pm to the blaze on Warawara Forest Road at Pawarenga.</p>
        
            <p>It was in a remote area near the Golden Stairs Walkway area and there was no road access for fire trucks.</p>
        
            <p>The Golden Stairs Walkway is in a remote area accessible only on foot or on horseback. It starts beside Whangapē Harbour, near the settlement of Pawarenga, and emerges on the west coast north of Mitimiti.</p>
        
            <p>The walkway is thought to take its name from the kōwhai trees that used to turn the hillside a blazing yellow in spring.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said no known structures were at risk and the wind was favourable, blowing the fire towards Whangapē Harbour.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews have been monitoring the blaze overnight and helicopters will be joining them on Saturday morning.</p>
