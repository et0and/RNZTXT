            <p>A former Te Pāti Māori chief of staff has recalled the pride the late Tariana Turia would show for her grandson, whose death was announced on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Tributes have poured in for gifted player Pakaitore Turia from rugby clubs all across Wellington and his current club in Queensland.</p>
        
            <p>His grandmother was former Te Pāti Māori co-leader and founder Tariana Turia who also died earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>Helen Leahy said his grandmother would express her joy about his achievements to everyone at Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>"Nanny Tariana would talk to the VIP drivers, talk to the security team, officials in the office, if anyone happen to mention the word rugby she would say: 'Do you know my mokopuna?'," Leahy said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the first thing everyone noted was his smile describing him as a charmer and cheeky.</p>
        
            <p>"There are lots of stories of the mischief he would get up to... a boy that was absolutely adored," Leahy said.</p>

            <p>It was not uncommon for whānau who lived in Whanganui to travel to Wellington to watch when he was a first five-eighths and a fullback for Pōneke Rugby Football Club.</p>
        
            <p>He was a great golfer who was also agile on the rugby field.</p>
        
            <p>"He would calculate the right kick, the right cast that seemed to mesmerise crowds when they watched him. I saw one of the reviews which talked about him being exciting, consistently exciting and that's what we all loved about him is that he had that ability to break when you least expected it.</p>
        
            <p>"So that's part of the talent and the tenacity and also the cheekiness," Leahy said.</p>
        
            <p>His whānau were in Brisbane to determine how they would bring him home.</p>
        
            <p>"To lose their beloved Nanny Tari and then the apple of their grandparent's eye, Pakai, in such short time is devastating for them all."</p>
        
            <p>However, they were a whānau who had "great strength and great resilience", she said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Pōneke Rugby Football Club has remembered Turia as a young man who lit up any space as well as being a leader.</p>
        
            <p>Club captain Tom Anderson said his personality was the same on and off the field.</p>
        
            <p>"He always wanted to have fun. I guess on the field that was about expressing himself and showing his skill set, and setting up others and celebrating others' success on the field as well as off it," Anderson said.</p>
        
            <p>"He always had a smile on his face, he was always keen on a joke and a laugh and a dance. He'd be the one that spoke about the dance floor in the rugby club."</p>
        
            <p>Turia showed great sportsmanship with other clubs and would treat the members the same as his team-mates.</p>
        
            <p>"They're mourning his loss as well because they enjoyed the challenge and the fun that he brought to the game when you played against a guy like Pakai. He was skilful, but he enjoyed it, he was always happy to sit down with the opposition afterwards."</p>
        
            <p>Turia played 113 premier games, scoring over 800 points for Pōneke Rugby Football Club.</p>
        
            <p>Anderson said the entire club was hurting and planned to come together on Wednesday night for those who knew him to share their memories.</p>
        
            <p>Turia's current club, Sunnybank Dragons Junior Rugby also took to social media saying it was deeply saddened by his loss.</p>
        
            <p>"Pakai was a part of the Sunnybank family from 2023, after relocating from Wellington, NZ.</p>
        
            <p>"Our hearts go out to his family, friends, and team-mates during this incredibly difficult time. As a community, we stand together in support."</p>
        
            <p>Another of his former clubs, Hutt Old Boys Marist Rugby Club, also posted a tribute.</p>
        
            <p>"We were privileged to have the talents and company of Pakai at the club during the 2020 season.</p>
        
            <p>"He was and will always be a much loved member of our Eagles family.</p>
        
            <p>"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Turia family and our friends at the Pōneke Football Club."</p>
