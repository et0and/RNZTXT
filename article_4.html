            <p>Public hospital wait times for cancer treatment, specialist appointments and surgery all got worse in the first three months of the year, according to a new report.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand's quarterly performance report, which has just been released, noted nearly 77,755 patients (40.2 percent) waited longer than four months for a first specialist appointment, compared with 68,179 (36.5 percent) in the previous quarter.</p>
        
            <p>The number of patients waiting for treatment longer than the four-month target increased from 39.5 percent (30,474) to 44 percent (34,428), including 2362, who had been waiting more than a year (up from 2175 in the previous quarter).</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the number of cancer patients treated within 31 days reduced from 85.4 percent to 81.9 percent.</p>
        
            <p>There was also "significant pressure" across all mental health and addiction services, and primary and community care was also strained due to "workforce and resourcing constraints", the report said.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora chief executive Margie Apa said the agency was "strongly focused on addressing these challenges".</p>
        
            <p>"This will take time but is achievable."</p>
        
            <p>During the quarter, 12 new clinical networks were also established, which would play a key role in improving service effectiveness across clinical specialties, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We know how committed our people are and how hard they are working. I want to thank everyone, in Health NZ and across all of our providers, for their commitment and contribution to our progress during the quarter."</p>
        
            <p>Positive progress included:</p>
