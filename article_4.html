            <p>A man has been arrested after a car hit a police officer and patrol vehicle in Huntly before fleeing.</p>
        
            <p>Police say the officer had been doing work at a property on an unrelated matter and was hit while stepping out of his car about 8pm on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>"Another vehicle drove toward them, colliding with the patrol vehicle and the officer," police said.</p>
        
            <p>The driver of the car then fled but was arrested later.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the officer was taken to Waikato Hospital with moderate injuries, but had since been discharged and was expected to fully recover.</p>
        
            <p>A 47-year-old man will appear in Hamilton District Court on Thursday charged with injuring with intent to cause grievous bodily harm over the incident.</p>
