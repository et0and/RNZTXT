            <p>Three-time Emmy nominee Melanie Lynskey and Robyn Malcolm will star in a film about the Pike River mine tragedy opening in cinemas later this year.</p>
        
            <p>Producers of the Robert Sarkies-directed movie have released a first glimpse of the film, with a photo of Lynskey and Malcolm playing Anna Osborne and Sonya Rockhouse.</p>
        
            <p>Both women lost men in the 2010 explosion and have become prominent in the families' fight for justice.</p>
        
            <p>Written by Fiona Samuels, the film is being shot in Greymouth, Wellington and Auckland, with some family members of the 29 men who died featuring as extras.</p>
        
            <p>Lucy Lawless plays unionist Helen Kelly in the movie, along with Tim Gordon as Pike Family Committee spokesperson Bernie Monk.</p>
        
            <p>Sarkies said the film captured the community impact of one of the worst mining disasters in New Zealand's history.</p>
        
            <p>"I couldn't be more thrilled to have actors of Melanie and Robyn's calibre in the film," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Their outstanding performances will remind audiences everywhere of the human cost of these kind of events, as well as the importance of fighting for what you believe is right.</p>
        
            <p>"Our entire cast and crew were inspired by the courage of the Pike River families and have worked so hard to do their story justice."</p>
        
            <p>Pike River includes a cast of more than 40 New Zealand actors who depict miners, Pike families and the wider West Coast community.</p>
        
            <p>Anna Osborne lost her husband, Milton, in the mine, while Sonya Rockhouse's 21-year-old son, Ben, died in the disaster.</p>
        
            <p>The men's bodies were never recovered but Pike River families have successfully pushed for re-entry to the mine.</p>
        
            <p>Police announced in September 2022 they were reopening the coal mine borehole drilling operation as part of the criminal investigation into the explosion.</p>
        
            <p>Last June they said imaging showed the remains of two or possibly three miners in the crib room area, although they were not able to identify them.</p>
        
            <p>The discovery meant the remains of up to 12 of the 29 men had been found.</p>
        
            <p>The film has been made in association with the New Zealand Film Commission, NZ On Air, Three, the New Zealand Screen Production Grant and Park Road Post Production.</p>
