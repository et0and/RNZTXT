            <p>The man charged with murder and attempted murder over a double shooting in Coromandel has pleaded not guilty in the High Court at Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>Kevin Mabbott died and Aaron Buckland was seriously injured when they were shot on a remote road on the Coromandel Peninsula last week.</p>
        
            <p>Stuart Edmondon appeared before Justice Muir on Tuesday and was supported by about a dozen people in the public gallery.</p>
        
            <p>The 77-year-old was wearing dark green clothes and the judge invited him to sit down during the proceedings.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Muir ordered Edmondson to remain in custody until his next appearance in February.</p>
        
            <p>Edmondson's lawyer Max Simpkins indicated to the court he planned to apply for bail before the next court date.</p>
        
            <p>A supporter of Edmondson outside court said he was an original bushman of New Zealand who has endured people killing animals on his land over the past 40 years.</p>
        
            <p>Heather (who did not wish to give a last name) said that the number of animals killed on Edmondson's property got worse at Christmas time.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really really sad situation," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She used to live on the road on which the incident took place and said she saw people killing or hurting the animals many times on Edmondson's property.</p>
        
            <p>"I was there once when a crossbow was in the pig's throat and - he doesn't kill his animals, he doesn't even kill his own animals - so he took it to the vet and it was $400 to remove the crossbow so he paid $400 to get it removed and save the pig… there is a lot of years of grief," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She said Edmondson called the police many times about the problem.</p>
        
            <p>Heather said tourists would come to visit Edmondson's property and see the pigs, which poachers would sometimes kill even in front of the tourists.</p>
        
            <p>"He is internationally known, and he is just known as a genuinely really good guy … he is quite famous for letting people hold his pigs, pat his pets, he's even let people take them ... He's genuinely a really kind, giving guy, he'd give you the shirt off his own back."</p>
