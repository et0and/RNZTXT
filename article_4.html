            <p>A worshipper at Al Noor Mosque was trapped in a room and verbally abused before the Christchurch terror attacks.</p>
        
            <p>The inquest into the deaths of the 51 worshippers murdered on 15 March 2019 was this morning played an audio recording of Imam Gamal Fouda which detailed the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Gamal Fouda described how two people came to the mosque and verbally abused a worshipper.</p>
        
            <p>"They were saying 'go back to your country' and they were very rude. They locked [the worshipper] in the kitchen and shouted at him," Fouda said.</p>
        
            <p>It was reported to police.</p>
        
            <p>"We report it that they are dangerous with the police and the police kept saying they can't do nothing and if they come back just ask them to leave."</p>
        
            <p>A volunteer at the mosque, who cannot be identified, had been giving evidence to the inquest this morning.</p>
        
            <p>The recording was played to him during questioning from Wendy Aldred, the counsel assisting the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>The witness said he remembered the two men were drunk and came into the mosque on a weekend night.</p>
        
            <p>He could not recall if they broke into the mosque or just walked in.</p>
        
            <p>Later, during questioning from another lawyer, the witness said such verbal abuse, directed at the Muslim community, "happens all the time".</p>

            <p>Deputy Chief Coroner Brigitte Windley was hearing evidence on an emergency door in the mosque's main prayer room which failed to open during the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Why the door failed to open and the regulatory regime surrounding emergency exits are being scrutinised during the two-week hearing.</p>
        
            <p>The door's failure to open potentially contributed to the deaths of 11 people.</p>
        
            <p>Fouda's statement included a claim that the emergency exit door in Al Noor Mosque's main prayer room was damaged during a robbery.</p>
        
            <p>"He [the offender] actually broke the door that didn't open [on 15 March 2019], so he used probably leverage to open the door and the frame got bent and when the police came, they suggested this lock is easy to be opened from outside with a screwdriver, so they need to replace it," Fouda said.</p>
        
            <p>"I reported it to the management and this is how they probably started fixing the door."</p>
        
            <p>The inquest yesterday saw photos which demonstrated damage to the lock's strike plate.</p>
        
            <p>The inquest also heard the door was old and a mechanical lock, which kept it shut, could be a "little tricky" to operate.</p>
        
            <p>When the gunman entered Al Noor Mosque, worshippers rushed for the door but could not open the lock and as a result, the glass in the bottom pane was smashed and some worshippers crawled out.</p>
