            <p>Covid-19 cases have dropped since last week but more people have died from the virus, including a child aged under 10.</p>
        
            <p>There have been 6814 new cases of Covid-19 reported in New Zealand over the week to Sunday, and 27 further deaths attributed to the virus.</p>
        
            <p>Of the new cases, 1193 were probable cases and 3595 were reinfections.</p>
        
            <p>There were 327 cases in hospital and eight in intensive care.</p>
        
            <p>The seven-day rolling average of new cases was 971 per day.</p>
        
            <p>Covid-19 booster vaccinations are available for anyone aged over 30 if it has been at least six months since their last injection or period of Covid-19 infection.</p>
        
            <p>Otago University public health expert Michael Baker told Morning Report boosters were "vital", particularly for older people and those who had underlying health conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"This is basic preventative medicine and if people are not getting their boosters they are far more likely to go to hospital."</p>
        
            <p>Last week Te Whatu Ora reported 7881 new cases and 20 further deaths.</p>
