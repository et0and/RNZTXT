            <p>It could take days to extinguish a wildfire burning in a Canterbury pine forest, Fire and Emergency says.</p>
        
            <p>Fire crews have been fighting the blaze north of Waipara in the Hurunui district since being alerted to it on Thursday night.</p>
        
            <p>The fire is roughly 105 hectares in size and incident commander Des Irving said it had been contained - but it was not under control.</p>
        
            <p>He said strong winds were expected to reduce over the weekend but there was no sign of rain.</p>
        
            <p>"We have significant challenges with the weather. The wind is gusting and it will gust up to about 70 kilometres an hour today," Irving said.</p>
        
            <p>"That's creating some issues for us."</p>

            <p>Five helicopters and three ground crews were working to bring the fire under control on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>They were reviewing the conditions to ensure it was safe for air support to continue, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The fire was in a forestry block surrounded by farmland and there was no immediate threat to any structures or properties, Irving said.</p>
        
            <p>People are urged to stay away from the area.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and smoke may be visible from State Highways 1 and 7.</p>
        
            <p>Irving described it as a "long duration event", but he hoped it would be under control by Saturday afternoon.</p>

            <p>"Once air operations are finished, there are trees still standing so we have to get in with our ground crews and extinguish the hotspots."</p>
        
            <p>That included using specialist equipment to check that were not any hotspots buried in the roots.</p>
        
            <p>He encouraged people to check the forecast and the Fire and Emergency CheckItsAlright website https://www.checkitsalright.nz/ before lighting a fire.</p>
        
            <p>"Please take extra care to monitor your burn piles and take action as needed," Irving said.</p>
        
            <p>"We often find old, extinguished burn piles reigniting during dry and windy weather conditions."</p>
        
            <p>It was currently "too dangerous" for a fire investigator to examine the area and work out the cause and origin of the fire, he said.</p>
        
            <p>
People are urged to stay away from the area while emergency crews work.
