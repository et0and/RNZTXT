            <p>Forensic police have been examining the cordoned-off car park by children's swings, a kindergarten and sports court and have set up a large blue tent.</p>
        
            <p>Rebecca Bovey, who was watching police work, said the stabbing was "bloody disgusting".</p>
        
            <p>"They're not going to have their family member for Christmas. It's upsetting for people," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A local dairy owner who did not want to be named said Wycola Avenue was usually a quiet street and he did not see anything unusual when he closed his shop last night.</p>
        
            <p>"It's no good for this small community, not at all. It's terrible for the families associated with these people," he said.</p>

            <p>Police said it was an isolated incident and they did not believe there was any risk to the public.</p>

            <p>Hornby Ward councillor Mark Peters said the death showed the need for 24/7 policing in the area. He said it had been years since Hornby Police Station was staffed around the clock.</p>
        
            <p>"It's something that we'd really like the police and the police minister to reconsider. Having a presence of personnel 24/7 would certainly be appreciated and from that they'd be able to have more presence on the street and therefor deter some of the activity that does go on."</p>
        
            <p>It would allow more rapid police responses and provide greater assurance to the community, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"That local presence allows the faster response and the better opportunity to nip it in the bud. So we are keen to work with the police to see if we can get that police station better manned so everyone can feel that little bit safer by having more local presence."</p>
        
            <p>Peters said it was a tragedy for friends and whƒÅnau of those involved, made even harder being so close to Christmas.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a family now that's going to have a loved one missing through the festive season . . . for any family that's a tragedy and for a community that's a tragedy. That's where as a community, as we always do, we need to wrap around each other and be there for each other and help each other through this time."</p>
        
            <p>Waipuna Halswell-Hornby-Riccarton Community Board member Henk Buunk agreed. "It points to the fact that we need a police presence in the area, " he said. "Always it's good to have the visible police presence - to see police on the ground is useful. It gives people peace of mind and allows people to know help is close at hand."</p>
