            <p>As most people return to work and study after the Easter break, a week of clouds, rain showers and drizzle is expected for most of the country.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday almost all of the North Island was forecast to have cloudy periods with showers in Northland spreading to Auckland and further south throughout the afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The Metservice said the South Island would have more fine spells but Marlborough and Nelson were likely to get isolated afternoon and evening showers, while Canterbury and North Otago could have patchy morning drizzle.</p>
        
            <p>The rest of the week is a fairly similar story: rain, clouds, and the occasional fine patch.</p>
        
            <p>Wednesday was expected to see the North Island mainly fine with possible showers in Northland, Bay of Plenty and Kapiti. While the South Island could look forward to rain in the west and late showers along the Southland coast.</p>
        
            <p>By Thursday the west of the North Island would be cloudy, with rain south of Waikato, and in the South Island the rain in the west would head north before clearly, though showers were likely in the east too.</p>
        
            <p>And on Friday the rain was expected to have made it's way to the top of the North Island, but there's another spell of showers in the far south. Though most of the rest of the country should be fine.</p>
