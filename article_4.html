            <p>A patient has died in Dunedin Hospital's cardiac unit, while staff were waiting for the catheterisation lab, where vital heart procedures are done, to be repaired.</p>
        
            <p>The Dunedin Hospital catheterisation (cath) lab has been unavailable for some invasive coronary procedures since 20 November due to an equipment issue.</p>
        
            <p>It is related to the equipment used for recording ECG and monitoring heart pressure during an angiography.</p>
        
            <p>Health NZ Southern Chief Medical Officer David Gow said replacement parts were immediately ordered, and the final part is due to arrive this week.</p>
        
            <p>"We have taken several measures to mitigate the impacts of this equipment fault. Patients awaiting or requiring access to the lab for these coronary procedures have continued to be clinically reviewed and monitored and one acute patient was diverted to Christchurch Hospital," Gow said.</p>
        
            <p>"We also commissioned the use of our Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) lab to enable the affected cardiology procedures to continue to be delivered at Dunedin Hospital. This means acute patients no longer need to be diverted to Christchurch. To date, three procedures have been completed in the DSA lab.</p>
        
            <p>"While we wait for the final part to arrive, we have managed to temporarily restore the functioning of the cath lab to enable the affected procedures to recommence. We have since completed 10 angiography procedures in the lab."</p>
        
            <p>The hospital is continuing to triage patients booked for elective or diagnostic procedures and to date 10 procedures have been deferred.</p>
        
            <p>Gow said the cause of death of the patient in the cardiac unit is unknown and has been referred to the coroner.</p>
