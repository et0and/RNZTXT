            <p>Profile pictures are turning black on social media in honour of the two people killed in a rally sprint crash in Northland.</p>
        
            <p>They have been named as 15-year old Brooklyn Horan, and his co-driver Tyson Jemmett, 35.</p>
        
            <p>Their car crashed into a ditch during the Arcadia Road Rallysprint in Paparoa about 2pm on Sunday, 25 February; they died at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Social media users have changed their pictures to a black square, or a black background with a gold 89, Brooklyn's driver number.</p>
        
            <p>MotorSport New Zealand said it would cooperate with all investigating agencies as well as undertake its own thorough investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Separate from the rally sprint, Brooklyn was also a competitor in the Toyota 86 Championship.</p>
        
            <p>Toyota Gazoo Racing New Zealand motorsport manager Nicolas Caillol said the teen was a "promising talent" who was getting better and better, round after round, with a couple of recent top five finishes.</p>
        
            <p>According to the rules on the MotorSport New Zealand website, the junior driver program "allows people aged between 12 and 16 the ability to obtain a competition licence with a few extra steps".</p>
        
            <p>Caillol said it was not uncommon for young drivers to participate in this kind of competition.</p>
        
            <p>"We have drivers as young as 13 or 14. To race on circuits in New Zealand you need to be 12. I understand in rally you need to be a bit older."</p>
        
            <p>And it was not uncommon for drivers without a road licence to have a competition licence.</p>
        
            <p>"The best example is Max Verstappen, Formula 1 champion - he was driving in Formula 1 before he got his road license," he said. "When he joined Formula 1 he was only 17."</p>
        
            <p>Tributes have been appearing on social media since midday.</p>
        
            <p>Offroad Racing NZ said Brooklyn was "super-fast in any machine, on any surface. Gone too soon".</p>
        
            <p>Racer Products called him "a great kid to deal with. His future was bright and he will be missed".</p>

            <p>Winger Motorsport said: "On behalf of the team at Winger Motorsport, we send our condolences to the friends and family of Brooklyn Horan and his co-driver Tyson."</p>
        
            <p>1Eighty Racing said: "Such a raw talent! You will be missed on the track and our thoughts go out to your family."</p>
        
            <p>Hodgson Motorsport posted on Facebook on Monday: "It is with a very heavy heart that today we heard the absolutely devastating news that Brooklyn passed away doing the very thing we grew to love together as families.</p>
        
            <p>"It's times like these that you remember that the sport we chose comes with the highest of highs and the lowest of lows."</p>
        
            <p>"Brooklyn you were an amazing kind loving happy kid and that hadn't changed years later when we crossed paths again back at off-roading last year, the cheeky smile was still the same, you had just grown a weeee bit taller."</p>
        
            <p>Jemmett was a member of staff in Stuff's commercial team.</p>
        
            <p>According to Stuff, he was a "keen motorsport enthusiast and beloved husband".</p>
        
            <p>Stuff chief executive Laura Maxwell said Jemmett was much-loved and respected, and made a huge contribution to the formation of the company's audio division.</p>
        
            <p>Brooklyn was driving the car when it crashed, Stuff confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>MotorSport New Zealand chief executive Elton Goonan told Morning Report it was still trying to compile the details of the crash. "The car veered off the road into a ditch, and that's as much as I know at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>He said there was no suggestion that the rules needed to change at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>"Our rules we set in alignment with our international governing body and they've been in place nearly 75 years now, so it's something we definitely don't want a knee-jerk reaction on, but it's something that will definitely be looked at very very closely."</p>
