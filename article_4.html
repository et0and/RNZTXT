            <p>A man has been arrested after he rammed a car driven by a member of public in a chase involving armed police.</p>
        
            <p>Police said cordons were set up in Te Horo on the KƒÅpiti Coast, north of Wellington, after a vehicle of interest was spotted in Waikanae at about 7am.</p>
        
            <p>The 35-year-old was then seen by officers at a checkpoint in Otaki where he fled in the vehicle, reversing into a car driven by a member of the public. They were not hurt.</p>
        
            <p>The vehicle crashed a short time later and the man was taken into custody.</p>
        
            <p>He is being treated for injuries.</p>
        
            <p>A photo on a local Facebook page showed about dozen officers and Fire and Emergency staff standing beside the Otaki motorway.</p>
        
            <p>Traffic management is in place while the man's car is removed.</p>
