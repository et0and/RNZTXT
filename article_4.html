            <p>Kiwis visiting Laos should be cautious of consuming alcoholic beverages, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade says.</p>
        
            <p>The updated travel advisory comes after several cases of suspected methanol poisoning from alcoholic drinks.</p>
        
            <p>Five people have reportedly died of poisoning in the country bordering Thailand, and a New Zealander is also unwell.</p>
        
            <p>MFAT said travellers should be cautious about consuming alcoholic beverages, particularly cocktails and drinks made with spirits that may have been adulterated with harmful substances.</p>
        
            <p>It is urging travellers to become familiar with the signs of methanol poisoning and seek immediate medical attention if poisoning is suspected.</p>
        
            <p>Monash University's department of forensic medicine Professor David Ranson told Checkpoint that "this is a very tragic story".</p>
        
            <p>The acid that forms with methanol is what caused the most harm, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the formic acid that causes so many problems, so this is an agent that actually kills cells and as a result it causes really quite significant damage to the body."</p>
        
            <p>"Quite often it takes a day or so for these symptoms to come on, particularly if the source of the methanol has been essentially combined with ethanol."</p>
        
            <p>A lethal dose could be quite small, Ranson said.</p>
        
            <p>"It depends on the amount that's in the drink, actually it's a surprisingly a small amount.</p>
        
            <p>"Even 20-30mls can be really quite dangerous and in some people that could be fatal.</p>
        
            <p>"In fact quite often people finish up having more than that, simply because if they're having several drinks that are all contaminated, it all adds up."</p>
        
            <p>Ranson said there are remedies that can help if they are given in time for methanol poisoning.</p>
        
            <p>"There are some treatments specifically designed to block the enzyme in the body, so that the methanol will not get broken down and cause these nasty agents to be produced.</p>
        
            <p>"And if you can do that fairly early on you can keep the level of these nasty chemicals down, and people will then have a much better chance of survival."</p>
        
            <p>Ranson said the most important thing if you suspect methanol poisoning is, "you have to get to hospital right away."</p>
        
            <p>Checkpoint spoke to the New Zealand Drug Foundation and its principal science adviser said there are no off the shelf rapid tests for methanol in drinks.</p>
        
            <p>The foundation's advice is to only drink canned or bottled drinks with a seal when travelling in Southeast Asia.</p>
