            <p>A person was threatened with a machete before a gun went off outside Wellington Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Detective Senior Sergeant Tim Leitch said the altercation began shortly after 5pm on Wednesday outside a motor lodge across the street from the hospital.</p>
        
            <p>A person was threatened with a machete by a person driving a white Ford Range.</p>
        
            <p>Leitch said the threatened person then grabbed a firearm and along with another person, jumped into a grey Mitsubishi Colt and drove into the hospital car park, opposite the emergency department's entrance.</p>
        
            <p>"They then drove the wrong way up the main vehicle exit stopping outside the main hospital entrance at 5.16pm where the Ford Ranger was now parked.</p>
        
            <p>"A further confrontation occurred between the occupants of the two vehicles before a firearm was discharged towards the Ford Ranger.</p>
        
            <p>"Both vehicles and their occupants immediately left the area."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, staff at Wellington Hospital said extra security was in place.</p>
        
            <p>A nurse at the hospital said the main reception was open on Thursday morning, but people were having to use a buzzer to be let into wards, and staff moving between wards needed to use swipe cards.</p>
        
            <p>Leitch said police wanted to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the incident and seen the vehicles involved in the area.</p>
        
            <p>"The incident occurred in a very busy public place and a number of witnesses including hospital visitors and taxis we close by at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"Initial indications suggest those involved were known to each other and there is not an immediate threat to the wider public."</p>
        
            <p>Those involved have not yet been found by police - but officers are following "positive" lines of inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>Leith said a scene guard was in place outside the motor lodge and there would be an increased police presence in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Te Whatu Ora Capital Coast & Hutt Valley Hospital & Specialist Services group director operations Jamie Duncan told RNZ staff who witnessed the incident were being supported.</p>
        
            <p>Police asked anymore with information, including photos or videos, to call 105 or make a report online.</p>
        
            <p>Information could also be given anonymously by calling Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
