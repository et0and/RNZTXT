            <p>The Westland District Council has resorted to designing special kea proof bins in a bid to keep the cheeky taonga out.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation approached the council about getting some bins for Franz Josef so the kea couldn't break into them and raid them for food.</p>
        
            <p>Council operations manager Erle Bencich said it discovered none of the bins available were fit for purpose so it decided to tackle the problem in a New Zealand first approach.</p>
        
            <p>"So, we put our engineering skills to good use and in conjunction with a supplier came up with a lid design that has a spring-loaded door with a narrow aperture, which fits on the standard receptacle base," Bencich said.</p>
        
            <p>Seven of the 240 litre bins with kea proof lids were installed in Franz Josef this week.</p>
        
            <p>"It would be great to see them installed across the country wherever cheeky kea are getting into public rubbish bins."</p>
        
            <p>The lids and bins were manufactured by Tilley Group Ltd.</p>
