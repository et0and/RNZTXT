        <h2>Council told to explore cheaper sewerage option for Taranaki beach settlements</h2>
        <p>
New Plymouth council staff have been told to explore lower-cost alternatives to a $41 million sewerage scheme for two beach settlements in the district - equivalent to $180,000 for each household.

            <p>New Plymouth council staff have been told to explore lower-cost alternatives to a $41 million sewerage scheme for two beach settlements in the district - equivalent to $180,000 for each household.</p>
        
            <p>It has proposed a targeted rate of up $150 a year would pay for the Urenui and Onaero scheme which would service just 288 properties as well as dozens of baches and two campgrounds in the area.</p>
        
            <p>A meeting of the strategic projects committee considered an Urenui and Onaero Wastewater - Deep Dive report on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>At the conclusion of the presentation, mayor Neil Holdom argued that rather than simply receiving the report an amendment be moved asking for council staff to investigate cheaper alternatives.</p>
        
            <p>"So, we've just really got to keep and eye on those costs and while we are committed to solving the environmental issues. We've got poo in the river and in the estuary and in the mudflats. We've got to find a way to get that out, but we can't just blindly pursue one option without ensuring what are the other solutions."</p>
        
            <p>Holdom - who speculated there might be a waterless solution - worried that a wastewater scheme for the two settlements that was estimated to cost $4m when first raised in 2004 could blow out even beyond the $41m mark.</p>
        
            <p>"Historically, we've often seen indicative prices are about half the final price once you've gone out to tender and started construction, so at the moment it's $41 million, but we haven't been through consenting, we haven't been to the Environment Court, we don't know what conditions will be put on us."</p>
        
            <p>He also wanted to know whether new fast-track consenting legislation could apply to the project.</p>
        
            <p>"I haven't seen the legislation, but we've now got a fast-track route and if that can reduce the consenting time from potentially five years or more to a shorter period we can still do a thorough job and we can get on and clean up the environment which is ultimately the goal we are looking for."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Bryan Vickery supported the amendment - which was ultimately carried - but warned against any form of compromise.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm supportive of this, but I just thought it's important to make the comment that when we had the inspection we had a tremendous presence from Ngāti Mutunga and they were adamant they did not want any compromises because this is a big deal for them, so it is really important we address the faecal matter because it's hugely important."</p>
        
            <p>The amendment was passed unanimously.</p>
        
            <p>Ngāti Mutunga representatives who were in the council chamber to hear the presentation on the deep-dive report left before the amendment was moved.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson said the call to investigate cheaper alternative schemes was news to him and the iwi would have to liaise with council before commenting further.</p>
        
            <p>The deep-dive report said human faecal matter leaking from septic tanks in the area contaminating the Urenui River and mudflats was a long-standing issue, noting the "property size and soil [type was] not suitable for septic tanks in large parts of Urenui and Onaero townships".</p>
        
            <p>It said the current Urenui septic tank drain field - at the Urenui Domain - was on land significant to Ngāti Mutunga and the leach fields at Onaero were close to an eroding cliff. Flow rates at both septic tank drain fields were in breach of current resource consents and subject to abatement notices.</p>
