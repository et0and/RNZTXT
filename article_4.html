            <p>Ambulance operators are urging holidaymakers to respect their staff after an ambulance was vandalised on New Year's Eve.</p>
        
            <p>St John responded to 270 events throughout the country between 10pm and 3am. Although callouts were down by more than 15 percent on the previous New Year period, the number was more than half of a normal night.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy chief executive of ambulance operations Dan Ohs said with people in high spirits, came high emotions.</p>
        
            <p>"We do see some unusual behaviour from people in the public ... we would remind them to be kind to ambulance staff.</p>
        
            <p>"One of our ambulances yesterday had its windscreen broken by someone we were trying to help, which meant that was an ambulance taken out of service right as we were entering into New Year's Eve. That's the kind of behaviour that we're looking to avoid.</p>
        
            <p>The most ambulance callouts overnight were in Hamilton, Taupō, Wanaka, Christchurch and Manukau.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealanders were among the first in the world to celebrate the arrival of 2024 with firework displays.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland the fireworks illuminated the cloudy night sky and were accompanied by a laser light and animation show.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington went ahead with its waterfront concert and fireworks, despite high winds that forced the cancellation or delay of flights through the city earlier yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>Crowds gathered on the waterfront throughout the evening.</p>
        
            <p>But rain, thunder and high winds dampened celebrations in many centres.</p>
        
            <p>The Grey District Business Association on the West Coast cancelled last night's party in the town square and fireworks display because it was too dangerous to set up electrical equipment.</p>
        
            <p>Tauranga District Council also pulled the pin on five community events and one fireworks display.</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were "generally pleased" with New Year's Eve behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>Assistant Commissioner Mike Johnson said officers across Aotearoa described it as "being like a busy Saturday night, with some alcohol-related disorder but no significant issues".</p>
        
            <p>He said a number of youths were arrested in Whangamatā, Ōhope and Tauranga arrested for disorderly behaviour.</p>
        
            <p>"While this kind of behaviour is always disappointing, it's really pleasing to see the vast majority of people in communities right across the country had a safe and enjoyable night seeing in the new year."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Sydney hailed 2024 with a dazzling fireworks display featuring silver and gold pyrotechnics to mark the 50th anniversary of its the Opera House.</p>
        
            <p>And at his Sunday prayers at the Vatican, Pope Francis said he wished everyone a peaceful end of the year.</p>
