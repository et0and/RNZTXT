            <p>Mistakes in setting rates and a best-guess system for valuing assets have earned the West Coast Regional Council a do-better warning from its auditor.</p>
        
            <p>The council's Risk and Assurance committee held a marathon three-hour meeting on Tuesday with newly-appointed independent chair Graeme McGlinn at the helm.</p>
        
            <p>The experienced accountant who performs the same service for several other councils, spent Monday with council staff to discuss West Coast Regional Council's [WCRC] systems and finances.</p>
        
            <p>At the top of Tuesday's agenda was the 2023-24 audit report.</p>
        
            <p>Ernst and Young auditor Stuart Mutch flagged 16 areas where the council needed to improve, two of them coded red - or high risk.</p>
        
            <p>The first was the 2023 rates mix-up, when the council made errors in applying the valuations across different rating districts, then had to credit ratepayers and re-invoice them.</p>
        
            <p>And mistakes in calculating rates for the One District Plan had generated significantly more rates revenue than the council had intended, the auditor found.</p>
        
            <p>It had aimed to collect $1 million - but ended up collecting an extra $244,000.</p>
        
            <p>The second high risk item for the auditor was uncertainty over the value of the council's main asset - its network of 66 kilometres of flood walls and stopbanks.</p>
        
            <p>"Flood control infrastructure assets represent council's key asset. The integrity of the valuation underlies the overall financial statements of council."</p>
        
            <p>The stopbanks throughout the region were often in remote places, and the council took care to document volumes and locations for work done, the auditor said.</p>
        
            <p>"However, there has not been a full review undertaken of the length, breadth, height, and condition of flood control infrastructure for some time, if at all."</p>

            <p>The GIS information (a system with geographical data) the council did hold did not provide a high standard basis for valuation purposes, the report said.</p>
        
            <p>The council accepted all of the auditor's recommendations and work had already begun to resolve the concerns, planning manager Stuart Genery reported.</p>
        
            <p>"Significant effort has subsequently focused on improving our rate setting processes. This was largely successful for the 2024 - 2025 financial year."</p>
        
            <p>Work was also underway on developing a comprehensive asset management system - a systematic survey using Lidar technology of every stopbank and floodwall in the region, to determine its condition and value.</p>
        
            <p>"The previous valuations were done by a desktop survey about six months ago," WCRC chair Peter Haddock told LDR after the meeting.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be a massive job to survey them in this detail - it will take some time. But it's important to have an accurate picture - the government requires it, and it affects our insurance cover."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Andy Campbell told Tuesday's meeting that based on the latest (desktop) study, the valuation of stopbank assets in his Wanganui catchment valuation had risen 30 percent, a figure he questioned.</p>
        
            <p>Haddock said basing valuations on total replacement costs was not realistic, and new valuations should take that into account.</p>
        
            <p>"If the stopbank is wiped out in a flood, you don't lose the armour rock - the (biggest boulders) don't go far - they can be recovered. And if it's an area like Punakaiki seawall, damaged in a sea surge, a lot of those rocks wouldn't go far either and could be re-used."</p>
        
            <p>Given the time it will take to resurvey every stopbank in the region, the council might face another qualified audit in the current reporting year, staff noted.</p>
        
            <p>Haddock said given the lack of staff at the WCRC when he became chair in 2023, the council had made great progress, with a full finance team now in place.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm pretty pleased with what they've done already to put new systems and controls in place; when I arrived there was just one guy in finance and he resigned and we had to get Price Waterhouse to fill in. We've come a long way."</p>
