            <p>An Auckland police officer has been charged with dangerous driving after the death of a motorcyclist during a chase last year.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the officer was pursuing a motorcycle on the Tauhinu Road off-ramp in Greenhithe on 13 July 2023 when the rider crashed.</p>
        
            <p>"Police had signalled for the rider to stop on State Highway 18 around 10.20am after units observed the vehicle speeding," Superintendant Shanan Gray said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>"Very shortly after lights and sirens were activated, the rider has lost control of the motorcycle and crashed."</p>
        
            <p>The motorcyclist died at the scene, prompting a police investigation that eventually concluded the officer had been driving dangerously.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, police confirmed the officer had been charged with dangerous driving causing death and placed on restricted duties while the case was before the Auckland District Court.</p>
        
            <p>The crash also prompted an investigation by the Independent Police Conduct Authority which had not yet been completed.</p>
        
            <p>Because of that, police said they were unable to comment further at this time.</p>
