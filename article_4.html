            <p>A fire at a Manuwatū property that is connected to the search for missing woman Breanna Muriwai was deliberately lit, police have confirmed.</p>
        
            <p>Muriwai was last seen in August 2022 at Te Horo Beach on the Kāpiti Coast.</p>
        
            <p>Searches were carried out to locate her, and her movements on the night she disappeared were examined by police.</p>
        
            <p>The fire at the property, which had been vacant for a number of weeks, occurred shortly before 6pm that day.</p>
        
            <p>A scene examination has now been completed, confirming the fire was deliberately lit, along with item discovery from the property which is believed to be a "crude incendiary device".</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said relevant CCTV footage has been obtained and is being reviewed to see if it offers any lines of inquiry.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, Muriwai's family spoke out about a planned farewell for her.</p>
        
            <p>Mother Jasmin Gray posted a live video update on Facebook, saying she wants to organise a large convoy of vehicles to drive to Te Horo Beach in October, or later on in summer.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to make sure when Breanna's final hoorah comes up that I've been raising a bit of money to have a special memorial day for Breanna so my kids get to have closure.</p>
        
            <p>"It's going to be a beautiful day, a beautiful kind of send off for Breanna. This is not just for Breanna ... this is for all the missing ... all the vulnerable," she said.</p>
