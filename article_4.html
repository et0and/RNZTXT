            <p>Armed police, supported by the Eagle helicopter, descended on a home in Auckland after a man was found critically injured on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said they were called to an address on Wallace Road in Papatoetoe just after 9pm.</p>
        
            <p>They said police were armed in precaution, as initial reports did not indicate how the man was hurt. The New Zealand Herald reported he was stabbed.</p>
        
            <p>No charges have been, laid but another man - known to the victim - was assisting police.</p>
