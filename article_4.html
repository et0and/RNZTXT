            <p>Deer have been on the loose in a Christchurch suburb, with one reportedly hitting a car and another causing damage to a house.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson said there had been several reports of deer being seen in the Halswell area since 1pm on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>One such sighting related to a car being damaged, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"One of those related to a car hitting a deer, however, the deer ran off into bushes, the car driver was OK, [but] their car was a bit damaged."</p>
        
            <p>There had not been any further sightings of deer since 5.30pm, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch City Council said animal management staff had received a call about the deer.</p>
        
            <p>The deer were last seen by officers two hours ago, and "have not been seen since".</p>
        
            <p>Halswell resident Sam Palmer said one of the deer had caused damage to his house.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd been out and about all day, and then I got home about 4pm, and I noticed some damage to the eaves of our house, and a really dirty and smelly window."</p>
        
            <p>Palmer said he thought the damage might have been caused by vandalism, until he saw a video of the deer on his street.</p>
        
            <p>"I put two and two together and that explained the smell and the hairs on the window."</p>
        
            <p>"It'd have punched upwards. So it had hit the window and gone upwards through the eaves of our house."</p>
        
            <p>The deer had left a hole, and left Palmer searching for a repairman.</p>
        
            <p>"If you know a builder that's not too deer, that'd be great."</p>
