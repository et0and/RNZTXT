            <p>The lowest temperature on Thursday morning was at Mosgiel in the South Island where it was -5.3C, while Queenstown and Invercargill were -2C and -1C, respectively.</p>

            <p>MetService meteorologist John Law said the southerly change hit Wellington overnight with wet, cloudy weather forecast for the lower half of the North Island on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Overnight temperatures will be cold heading into Friday with a cold and frosty start to the day for many places, he said.</p>

            <p>Niwa forecast that it was set to be a mainly fine day on Thursday, except for the east coast of the North Island and the north-east of the South Island.</p>
