            <p>The Court of Appeal has upheld David Wayne Tamihere's convictions for the 1989 murders of Swedish backpackers Heidi Paakkonen and Urban Höglin.</p>
        
            <p>This is despite finding there had been "a miscarriage of justice" at trial.</p>
        
            <p>In their just-released judgment, the panel of judges concluded false testimony from a jailhouse informant and evidence about a watch later found to be wrong may have influenced the original jury.</p>
        
            <p>However, the weight of other evidence against Tamihere was enough to establish his guilt "beyond reasonable doubt".</p>
        
            <p>"We accept that it remains impossible to know the couple's precise movements after they were seen in Thames on 7 April and why they were killed. But we do not accept that it is impossible to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tamihere killed them."</p>
