            <p>A man is in custody following a death in Pātea on Saturday morning, after what police are calling a "family harm incident".</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to the Dorset Street address about 8.55am, where they found a man with critical injuries.</p>
        
            <p>"Despite efforts of emergency services, he was unable to be revived and died at the scene," Detective Senior Sergeant Debra Gower said.</p>
        
            <p>A 34-year-old man was arrested at the scene, she said, and a homicide investigation launched.</p>
        
            <p>"Cordons are in place and a scene examination will be carried out over the coming days. We do not believe there is any ongoing risk to the public."</p>
        
            <p>Gower said locals should expect an increased police presence in the South Taranaki town as the investigation continues.</p>
