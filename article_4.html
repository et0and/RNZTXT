        <h2>'Pretty sore legs, pretty sore calves' - How to set a world record for swinging</h2>

It had highs and it had lows, but after two days of swinging, the world record title may soon be swinging its way to our shores.

            <p>It had highs and it had lows, but after two days of swinging, the world record title may soon be swinging its way to our shores.</p>
        
            <p>Patrick Cooper is in the process of another world record attempt, after 48 hours of virtually non-stop swinging at Waitangi Park in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>His attempt over the weekend smashed the previous Guinness World Record by 11 hours and raised money for a mental health charity.</p>
        
            <p>Kicking off at 1.30pm on Friday, Cooper said he swung through a stunning couple of days in Wellington - enjoying the rev-up from Cuba Dupa party-goers and Park Run faithfuls - before dismounting in style, with a backflip, on Sunday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>"And as soon as I hopped off, I wasn't quite as balanced as what I usually am.</p>
        
            <p>"Pretty sore legs, pretty sore calves, but other than that I'm feeling pretty good."</p>
        
            <p>Speaking to RNZ on Tuesday he said the challenge was almost more mental than physical, with the hours between 4am-6am proving particularly dire.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd say the low point was going straight through the night .. the hours just before the sun comes up, everyone was really tired.</p>
        
            <p>"Just the vibe all around the park - everyone wanted to go to bed."</p>

            <p>Although the record attempt allowed for a five-minute toilet break every hour, Cooper said he was strategic about when and how he took them.</p>
        
            <p>Snatching only two quick pit-stops in the first 36 hours, Cooper said he stacked the unused breaks to give himself an hour power nap on the home stretch.</p>
        
            <p>However, numb legs and vertigo meant he almost stacked-it himself when taking his first toilet break 12 hours into the swing-a-thon.</p>
        
            <p>Cooper said things improved from there with regular stretching, and encouragement from onlookers kept the momentum going.</p>
        
            <p>"All the people coming to and from Cuba Dupa were really entertaining, especially through the night."</p>
        
            <p>Aside from bruised feet, the result of "too-tight" shoes, and a sore ankle from one dodgy dismount, Cooper said his body had held up well - although a set of stairs immediately after the marathon swing session almost got the better of him.</p>
        
            <p>"I visited some friends and they have some stairs at their flat. I went to go up them and was like, 'oh s***'.</p>
        
            <p>Cooper said this week would be spent going through the world record submission with a fine-tooth comb, before sending it off to Guinness to be confirmed - a process that could take more than three months.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, he would be collecting the money pledged during his attempt and donating it to I Am Hope.</p>
