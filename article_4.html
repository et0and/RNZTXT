            <p>Some Oranga Tamariki staff will go on partial strike later this week over workloads and a pay offer described by the Public Service Association as insulting.</p>
        
            <p>PSA members at Oranga Tamariki will have a ban on working overtime, double-shifts, and on-call and after hours duties from Friday.</p>
        
            <p>PSA assistant secretary Fleur Fitzsimons said there had been a failure to address unmanageable workloads.</p>
        
            <p>"This strike, really, is in response to a zero pay offer and unmanageable workload demands from Oranga Tamariki, that do not allow quality social work practise to happen."</p>
        
            <p>Fitzsimons said they wanted to see a fair pay offer and workloads that allowed staff to give those needing aid adequate time and support.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an insulting pay offer that doesn't meet the cost of living," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"But also it's a failure to address unmanageable workloads that mean people are burning out and children and families aren't getting the support they need."</p>
        
            <p>Fitzsimons said those supported by Oranga Tamariki had high and complicated needs, and deserved social workers and support staff who had caseloads that would allow them to be provided adequate attention.</p>
        
            <p>"This strike is aimed at the government," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We will need to see a clear commitment to Oranga Tamariki workers, including workloads that mean families get the time and support they need, and a pay offer that is fair in the cost of living crisis that we're all facing."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Oranga Tamariki said because it was in the middle of bargaining, it could not comment.</p>
