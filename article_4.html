            <p>A severe thunderstorm watch is in place for much of the North Island today.</p>
        
            <p>MetService is warning scattered heavy showers and thunderstorms are expected from 2pm until 8pm.</p>
        
            <p>Watches are in place for Waikato, Waitomo, Taumaraunui, and Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>Some thunderstorms might be slow moving and produce localised downpours of up to 40mm of rainfall, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>It has also issued a severe thunderstorm watch for Rotorua, Taupō, Taranaki, and Taihape.</p>

            <p>It says driving conditions may be hazardous, with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand avoided extreme temperatures seen globally for the month of January, but Niwa's principal scientist says that should change in the coming months.</p>
        
            <p>Last month was the world's warmest on record, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service.</p>
        
            <p>There was a 1.75 degrees Celsius increase globally, but regional variants meant New Zealand instead had its coldest January since 2017.</p>
