            <p>A fire ban will be in place for the entire Wairarapa region from Tuesday, 23 January.</p>
        
            <p>Last week a fire ban was declared for the Wairarapa Coast, but increased danger has extended the ban to the whole region.</p>
        
            <p>The shift to a prohibited fire season at 8am Tuesday means no open-air fires are allowed, and all fire permits are revoked.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Fire and Emergency Wellington District community risk manager Philip Soal said there have been multiple vegetation fires in Wairarapa recently.</p>
        
            <p>"The region is experiencing hot, dry, and windy weather and vegetation will continue to dry out over the coming weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"It is in these conditions where we see wildfires start and spread very quickly."</p>
        
            <p>He said people need to take extra care and not carry out any activities that could pose a fire risk such as lawn mowing, welding or driving through long grass.</p>
        
            <p>Locals can also take simple steps to make their houses easier to defend against fire, including:</p>
