            <p>Auckland Transport is warning train users to expect delays, after a train from Hamilton broke down in Auckland on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Forty-four passengers were stranded on the Te Huia train for several hours when it stopped between Parnell and Britomart because of a mechanical fault.</p>
        
            <p>UPDATE 12:50All train lines have been cleared. Continue to expect delays while train services return to normal timetable. Onehunga Line services have also been reinstated. Replacement buses are still operating. Use the AT Mobile App for further details. Updates to follow. https://t.co/Leer6EpVh2</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport said the train was blocking one of two tracks, causing delays and cancellations for services travelling through the Britomart station.</p>
        
            <p>The passengers eventually got off at the Strand.</p>
        
            <p>Trains have resumed, but services have not yet returned to regular schedules.</p>
