            <p>A body found near the Birchville Dam in Upper Hutt was of missing man Bret Hill, police say.</p>
        
            <p>Police were notified about 1.40pm on Sunday that a body had been found.</p>
        
            <p>Formal identification established it was that of Bret Hill, 50, who had last been seen a week earlier.</p>
        
            <p>The body was removed on Sunday afternoon and a scene examination carried out.</p>
        
            <p>The death will be referred to the Coroner.</p>
        
            <p>The search had continued on Friday, with up to 50 people including Land Search and Rescue scanning the Hutt river.</p>
        
            <p>At that stage police said the last sighting was along Hutt River road north of Māoribank duck pond.</p>
        
            <p>His son Trenton Hill told RNZ it was his and his father's birthday on Saturday - the day before he went missing.</p>
        
            <p>Some of his whānau were coming over from Australia within the next week to assist with the search.</p>
        
            <p>Trenton previously told RNZ his dad had just got a new job and had been doing really well for the past three years. He said he had a past of mental health issues, but it had been a long time since he had "an episode".</p>
        
            <p>"It's been three years, nearly four years since the last episode, so this coming out of nowhere, just doesn't make sense."</p>
        
            <p>Police thanked members of the public who helped police and provided information during the search.</p>
