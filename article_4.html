            <p>Much of New Zealand can expect heavy rain on Friday but the weekend weather is looking brighter, MetService says.</p>
        
            <p>A low moving southeast should cross the South Island early on Friday morning, bringing heavy rain to several areas in the North Island and the west and north of the South Island, the forecaster said.</p>
        
            <p>Rain would be "draped" across the North Island, it said, and fans heading to Coldplay at Auckland's Eden Park could expect some "fairly intense bursts of rain".</p>
        
            <p>"If you're off to see Coldplay you might find it's a wet start, but hopefully by the time the encores come on you should be in for some drier weather there."</p>
        
            <p>There were also being warned to allow extra time for packed-out public transport.</p>
        
            <p>And wear a raincoat or poncho - they're selling for top dollar outside the venue, so get your mitts on one before heading out.</p>
        
            <p>Closed-toe shoes would also be a good idea, concert organisers said, and there were no umbrellas allowed at the venue, so fans are advised to leave them at home.</p>
        
            <p> How's the wet weather shifting? Today the heaviest rain is in the north and west of South Island↗ The wettest areas tomorrow shift to the central and upper North Island as a front moves across from west to east Much drier for most on Saturday as high pressure comes… pic.twitter.com/4P89xh3CdR</p>
        
            <p>Much of the North Island had a warm, muggy night - with an overnight high of 18degC in Auckland - and the morning would be murky for many, it said.</p>
        
            <p>The warmest part of the motu on Friday would be Blenheim with 24degC, followed by Northland, Tauranga, Auckland and Hamilton, all with a daytime high of 21degC.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain warnings are in place for the following areas:</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain watches are currently in place for Northland, northern Taranaki, Waitomo, Taumarunui and northern Taihape, including the Tongariro National Park.</p>
        
            <p>The East Coast and Wellington will see scattered rain towards the end of the day.</p>
        
            <p>In the South Island, the wind was turning back towards the south, bringing a cooler, cloudier end to Canterbury Anniversary Day, with "the odd rumble of thunder" for inland areas and a high of 20degC for Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Saturday will dawn fine and cool, with a few showers in eastern and southern areas, including Canterbury and around Gisborne.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, a ridge of high pressure will bring fine skies to New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Westland mayor Helen Lash told Morning Report the district was hoping for brighter days after the second drenching of rain in a week.</p>
        
            <p>Westland was placed under a state of emergency at the weekend when rain caused flooding and slips.</p>
        
            <p>And it was having a wet end to the week, making the soaked ground even soggier.</p>
        
            <p>Lash said the persistent rain had been tough for tourist businesses heading into their busy season.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 6 remained closed between Haast and Lake Moeraki because of slips, and would remain so until at least Sunday, said the the NZ Transport Agency.</p>
        
            <p>However, Jacksons Bay Road had reopened despite heavy rain causing more slip debris.</p>
        
            <p>Westland District Council said motorists should expect minor delays on the road while contractors cleaned up the additional debris.</p>
        
            <p>A further 100mm of rain fell in the Haast areas overnight after last weekend's downpour caused flooding, slips and closed roads.</p>
        
            <p>Slips were still active and drivers should take extra care between Neils Beach and Jacksons Bay, the council said.</p>
