            <p>Fire and Emergency said it had sent firefighters to three places where building or roof materials were reportedly lifting in the wind, and two callouts for low-hanging powerlines or telephone lines.</p>
        
            <p>A taxi driver reported seeing cyclists blown off their bikes by wind gusts in Evans Bay, near the airport.</p>
        
            <p>Around 350 households were reported to be without power in the Wellington region on Friday morning, but that had since been restored.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, people preparing to travel over the Labour Weekend were advised to leave early, with bad weather on the way.</p>
        
            <p>The upper South Island and lower North will be hit hardest on Saturday, though few places nationwide will be spared, MetService said on Thursday.</p>
