            <p>Crown Research Institute staff are to learn their fate today, with the likely release of a long-delayed report expected to overhaul the science sector.</p>
        
            <p>The Science System Advisory Group (SSAG) - led by Sir Peter Gluckman - was set up in March 2024 by Judith Colins, the Minister for Science, Innovation and Technology at the time, to advise on improving the science system.</p>
        
            <p>The recent cabinet reshuffle will mean Dr Shane Reti will be overseeing the delivery of group's highly anticipated recommendations, the release of which are now several months behind schedule.</p>
        
            <p>The group was due to give its initial report in June and a second report in October last year, but neither have been made public.</p>
        
            <p>Those within the sector have told RNZ they are expecting to learn the fate of the seven Crown Research Institutes (CRI) - companies that carry out scientific research for the country - on Thursday, with many predicting that certain institutes will be merged.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands senior leaders at CRIs were briefed on the SSAG report recommendations on Wednesday and will be informing staff on Thursday, to coincide with the report's release.</p>
        
            <p>Answering questions about the country's economic growth yesterday, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the government would be further discussing the role of science in the economy.</p>
        
            <p>"You'll hear us talk more about how we plan to... operationalise the science and technology system so that we can get better businesses and bigger businesses in place."</p>
        
            <p>The Prime Minister is due to deliver his annual State of the Nation address on Thursday.</p>
