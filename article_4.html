            <p>More people need to learn how to keep kiwi safe as an increasing number are being found in suburban areas, Save the Kiwi says.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, a kiwi wandered into a sawmill workshop in WhangƒÅrei, then another was caught on CCTV in the Wellington suburb of Broadmeadows.</p>
        
            <p>Save the Kiwi chief executive Michelle Impey says dogs in particular are a major threat to kiwi, so avoidance training is necessary to reduce the threat of injuring or killing one.</p>
        
            <p>"We can have kiwi and dogs living alongside each other if we have got responsible dog owners keeping their dogs under control," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The training programme involves an owner walking their dog through a course that has kiwi scent like feathers, poo, or nesting material, and the dog is corrected with an electric collar if they show interest in it.</p>
        
            <p>While it will minimise the risk, Impey said avoidance training does not make a dog 'kiwi-proof'.</p>
        
            <p>Even after a dog had been trained, an uncontrolled or roaming dog may still attack a kiwi, especially if it was not regularly retrained, Impey said.</p>
