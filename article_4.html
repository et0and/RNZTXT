            <p>A sinkhole has opened up in the central Auckland suburb of St Marys Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council contractors and firefighters were called to the scene of the sinkhole, on the corner of Alice St and Dunedin St to block off the garbage-bin-sized hole.</p>
        
            <p>An RNZ reporter at the scene said no vehicles or homes appeared to be threatened by the sinkhole at this stage.</p>
        
            <p>A Fire and Emergency crew member told RNZ council contractors were likely to put a metal plate over the hole.</p>
        
            <p>
The hole looked to be quite deep.

            <p>The cause of the sinkhole is not yet clear.</p>
        
            <p>There have been a number of sink holes appearing in the city in the last few years.</p>
        
            <p>A massive sinkhole on St Georges Bay Rd in Auckland's Parnell disrupted businesses in the area for nearly six months after the Orakei Main Sewer line collapsed in September 2023.</p>
