            <p>A plane had to be flown over Lake Taupō to help find a paddleboarder seven hours after he entered the water.</p>
        
            <p>The man in his 60s had been blown 5 kilometres out over the lake, police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>He was last seen paddling off Waitetoko Beach, heading towards Motutaiko Island about 11am on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>At 3.50pm, the man's sister contacted police with concerns, and officers, the harbourmaster, as well as Coastguard volunteers for Taupō and Tūrangi started working to locate him.</p>
        
            <p>Because the man had no lifejacket, no personal beacon and no phone, a decision was made to get a plane in the air to help find him.</p>

            <p>Senior Constable Barry Shepherd said it was a "classic" example of the unexpected happening.</p>
        
            <p>"We found him about 6pm, five kilometres from his departure point, in the water holding on to the back of his board."</p>
        
            <p>The plane helped direct the harbourmaster and Coastguard to him and he was taken to shore.</p>
        
            <p>Shepherd said he could have "easily" died in the lake.</p>
        
            <p>"Because of the wind, he would've been blown right the way across the lake to the shoreline about 12km away … he wouldn't have been able to stop it."</p>

            <p>Anyone entering any body of water needed to take precautions, Shepherd said.</p>
        
            <p>"At the least, the bare minimum you need to do is wear a lifejacket on the water.</p>
        
            <p>"Everybody thinks 'it won't happen to me', when they should be thinking 'what if it does?'"</p>
