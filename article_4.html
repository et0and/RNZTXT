        <h2>Khandallah pool celebrates 100 years - but will it last?</h2>
        <p>
The pool could see out another 60 years with the right upgrade, councillor says - but its future is uncertain.

            <p>A Wellington City Councillor says a popular outdoor pool which turns 100 this year should be able to see out another 60 years, with the right upgrade.</p>
        
            <p>However, its future is uncertain as the council reviews its budget.</p>
        
            <p>The Khandallah Summer Pool opened in 1925 and locals are hosting a 100th birthday garden party on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>A planned upgrade for the pool is now one of 14 projects and plans on the chopping block as the council overhauls its long-term plan.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington city councillor Diane Calvert said the original $12 million upgrade was "over-inflated" and a technical advisory group was now considering how it could be done within the $7.1 million budget that had been set aside for it.</p>
        
            <p>"No one wanted to spend that amount of money but there's a lot of engineers and designers who believe we can do something to the pool - keep it at most simplest for approximately half that cost."</p>
        
            <p>The pool's future had looked uncertain in the last few years, and it was facing demolition after estimates to rebuild it came in over budget.</p>
        
            <p>Locals wanted a simple pool "with a bit of heating, and a bit of hot water in the showers" so the season could be extended, Calvert added.</p>
        
            <p>"The plan previously was pretty much gold-plated and and it changed the whole vibe of the pool. Basically people want a simple summer pool that has a bit of heat in it.</p>
        
            <p>"No one wants anything that's more than that."</p>
        
            <p>Nestled in the foothills of Mt Kaukau, Khandallah Summer Pool was the capital's last remaining swimming pool in an outdoor, natural setting, Calvert said.</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot of people in Wellington that have very fond memories of that pool and it was built by the community 100 years ago and it hasn't had any money spent on it for 60 years. So if we can get another 60 years out of it, I think it will be money well invested."</p>
