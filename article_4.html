            <p>Three 13-year-olds have been arrested for illegal street racing in Auckland overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Police responded to reports of two cars racing down Henderson Valley Road soon after midnight on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Waitematā West area response manager Senior Sergeant Damian Albert said officers stopped one of the vehicles on Gum Road, and found three teenagers inside.</p>
        
            <p>"All three were 13-year-olds and will be referred to Youth Aid," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Police found another car nearby, but it had been abandoned.</p>
        
            <p>"Both vehicles were soon confirmed as having been stolen and were recovered for their owners," Albert said.</p>
        
            <p>"Illegal street racing poses many risks to the community and it's just fortunate that neither set of occupants, or members of the public, were injured."</p>
