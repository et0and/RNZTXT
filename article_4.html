            <p>International travellers leaving from Wellington and Christchurch airports can expect a smoother time through security with the introduction of new scanning technology.</p>
        
            <p>The Civil Aviation Authority said the new technology would significantly improve aviation security operations.</p>
        
            <p>The new Computed Tomography scanning machines remove the need for physical bag searches in most cases.</p>
        
            <p>The CAA said they also meant electronics such as laptops and tablets, and liquids, aerosols and gels could stay in passengers' check in bags when they went through security.</p>
        
            <p>The new machines have been introduced in Wellington and Christchurch, and are expected in Auckland later this month.</p>
        
            <p>Group operations manager Karen Urwin said the new technology meant there was no need for passengers to struggle with unpacking at security screening.</p>
        
            <p>But those travelling with camera film would need to make sure it went in their checked in luggage to avoid any damage to it.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge this might present an inconvenience to those passengers, but security is our primary focus," Urwin said.</p>
        
            <p>"The last thing we want is for someone's wedding memories or holiday snaps to be destroyed going through screening, so please put your film in your checked luggage."</p>
