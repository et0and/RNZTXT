            <p>A set of road spikes were stolen from police while they were recovering a stolen car in Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday morning, police located a stolen vehicle travelling in Ōtāne.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Craig Vining said they were able to spike the blue Toyota Aqua hatchback at the intersection of Higginson Street and State Highway 2.</p>
        
            <p>"Police then monitored the vehicle as it travelled south through to Waipawa and then into Waipukurau," he said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Vining said due to the vehicle driving at excessive speed police did not pursue but later located the vehicle abandoned in a field on Pōrangahau Road.</p>
        
            <p>"Five youths were located climbing an adjacent hill and are being dealt with by Youth Aid Services," he said.</p>
        
            <p>But despite recovering the car, the road spikes were another matter.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, the set of road spikes were uplifted by a member of the public before they could be recovered from the roadside in Ōtāne," Vining said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you have any information on the whereabouts of the road spikes we ask you to please contact us."</p>
