            <p>Three men and a teenager appeared in court on Monday after police foiled a liquor store robbery in Kerikeri at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Senior Sergeant Peter Robinson said four people pulled up outside the Kerikeri Road store about 8.40pm on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>One person threatened a worker with a knife while two others ransacked the shop, taking cigarettes and alcohol.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson said all four were arrested when their car was stopped minutes later on Wiroa Road, an escape attempt foiled by cordons set up within minutes.</p>
        
            <p>The alleged offenders, aged 41, 28, 25 and 15, have been charged with aggravated robbery.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand how distressing incidents like these are for the victim and we hope these arrests will help provide reassurance to both the victim in this case and to the community," Robinson said.</p>
