            <p>Summer in New Zealand is synonymous with beaches, pools and barbecues. And, of course, long days spent in, or around, the water.</p>
        
            <p>We hit up those whose job it is to keep New Zealanders safe around the ocean and pools, to get the lowdown on what they'd never do in or around the water.</p>
        
            <p>It may seem obvious, but Raglan's Director of Lifesaving, Fletcher Harnish, says the most important thing he and his friends would never do, is drink before diving in.</p>
        
            <p>While it may be true that "everyone wants to do it" in summer, Harnish warned your body reacts, "so differently in the water" after a few drinks.</p>
        
            <p>For him, it's just not worth the risk.</p>
        
            <p>"Even as a lifeguard, I'd consider myself more than competent. I won't go swimming with my mates [under any influence]."</p>
        
            <p>For Victoria Mulrennan, Chair of the National Lifesaving Committee and United North Piha senior lifeguard, going in the water under the influence of anything is also "100%" something she'd also avoid.</p>
        
            <p>"It's definitely a hard one. Kiwis ... love a beach barbecue or a beer at sunset," she said, but insisted it's just not worth the risk - whether in the pool or ocean.</p>
        
            <p>For one, it's very easy to get knocked down by a wave in the ocean. Secondly, "if you had a bit of alcohol, you might lose your sense of risk a little bit. It's so important to have your wits about you".</p>
        
            <p>Mulrennan "definitely" wouldn't let her children in the water out of arm's reach, whether the pool or the beach.</p>
        
            <p>"Especially in the ocean, waves can take people off guard," she said, adding that children can be swept off their feet by a wave or current very quickly.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not even just about watching your child. It's about being close enough to grab them and help them."</p>
        
            <p>Harnish also pushed the importance of having children close enough to reach out and grab them if needed.</p>
        
            <p>"Just never leave kids unattended. They should always be within arm's reach," he said, adding that even older kids should always have an eye kept on them.</p>
        
            <p>Both Harnish and Mulrennan emphasised the importance of swimming at patrolled beaches and following the guidelines set out by Surf Lifesaving NZ (such as staying between the flags).</p>
        
            <p>Mulrennan, as an experienced, competent swimmer, said she would never go in the water at a beach that wasn't patrolled. For her, it would not be worth the risk.</p>
        
            <p>Similarly, she always makes sure to check safety online first.</p>
        
            <p>"I wouldn't head to the beach without checking Safe Swim first."</p>
        
            <p>This is more related to beaches, but on a similar note, Mulrennan said she would never enter the water if she had any doubts or concerns about conditions or safety of the water.</p>
        
            <p>"It's better safe than sorry. If you had any doubts I'd stay out of the water," she said.</p>
        
            <p>It's not just the conditions, she said. If she had any concerns about her ability to float, she'd stay out of the water.</p>
        
            <p>"A big one we've seen recently is people going into the water not just when they don't know how to swim but they don't know how to float," she said, adding that skill can be the "difference between life and death".</p>
        
            <p>"If you can float, you can keep yourself alive a lot longer than if you can't."</p>
        
            <p>If things go wrong and you do wind up getting into trouble, Harnish said it's important not to panic.</p>
        
            <p>"Relax," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Raise your hand to signal for help, and ride the rip. It'll slowly push you out, and you can wait for help out the back."</p>
        
            <p>On a related note, Harnish said many people aren't sure who to call when they see someone in trouble - thinking they need a lifeguard or the Coastguard.</p>
        
            <p>"If you see something going wrong, call 111 and ask for the police," he said, who will put the call out directly to the Marine Rescue Centre.</p>
