            <p>Kaikōura is ''absolutely pumping'' as tourists flock back to the seaside resort, mayor Craig Mackle says.</p>
        
            <p>Mackle said the town was the busiest he had seen it for several years, following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2016 and Covid-19 restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>''The place is absolutely pumping. I haven't seen it this busy in a long time. It is wonderful.</p>
        
            <p>''The food outlets are busy. I've seen The Pier [Hotel] absolutely pumping the meals out.''</p>
        
            <p>Destination Kaikōura manager Lisa Bond and chairperson Lynette Buurman said local businesses were enjoying a busy summer without the staff shortages of the last few years.</p>
        
            <p>''Over the last few weeks Kaikōura has been really busy with many families and holiday makers enjoying the beautiful weather,'' Bond said.</p>
        
            <p>''I am pretty sure ice creams have been in hot demand. There have been plenty of people swimming in the ocean, biking the cycle trails and enjoying a stroll along the new link pathway along Esplanade.''</p>
        
            <p>The town has hosted eight cruise ships visits so far this summer, with another nine scheduled visits to come.</p>
        
            <p>Buurman said the comments from cruise ship passengers have been positive.</p>
        
            <p>''The feedback is that we have a lovely, little port town with plenty of things to do.</p>
        
            <p>''I think all businesses will be having a good summer. Everyone is upbeat and we don't have the staffing challenges we had last summer.''</p>
        
            <p>Buurman is also business manager at Encounter Kaikōura.</p>
        
            <p>She said passenger volumes so far this summer were on a par with pre-Covid levels - the summer of 2019/20 - and at around 90 percent of pre-earthquake levels.</p>
        
            <p>''It is incredibly busy. It has been great for the town. We've had so many visitors and the weather has been superb.</p>
        
            <p>''It might ease off a little bit now that we are over those stat holidays, but our forward bookings are still pretty solid.''</p>
        
            <p>The opening of Kaikōura EcoZip Adventures on 20 December has added another on-land attraction to complement the on-water activities, Buurman said.</p>
        
            <p>Bond said there were plenty of attractions coming up including the annual Music on the Lawn at Fyffe House on Saturday, 20 January, and the Kaikōura A&P Show on Saturday, 24 February.</p>
        
            <p>The Kaikōura Memorial Hall is hosting concerts from Christchurch bands 1 Drop Nation on Friday, 19 January, and The Feelers on Saturday, 20 January.</p>
        
            <p>The Kaikōura Museum has its award winning Earthquake Exhibition running until the end of February.</p>
