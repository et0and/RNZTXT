            <p>A recent coronial finding into the death of young Waikato farming assistant Jayden Disher wants WorkSafe to focus on initiatives to limit on-farm electrocutions.</p>
        
            <p>15-year-old Disher died in 2019 in what Coroner Rachael Schmidt-McCleave found to have been an accidental electrocution.</p>
        
            <p>However, Schmidt-McCleave recommended WorkSafe New Zealand make changes to its powerlines guidance in the agriculture sector and issues a hazard alert in the hope it will reduce the chances of other similar deaths.</p>
        
            <p>Disher grew up on a farm. Five weeks before he died, he had left school and taken up a farm assistant role in Rangitoto, near Te Kuiti in Waikato.</p>
        
            <p>Farm owner Nathan Bluett said, despite his youth, Disher was an outstanding worker.</p>
        
            <p>"[Jadyen was] hard-working, well-liked, had a lovely nature and interacted well with people who came on to the farm. He was always willing to help. He really cared about the animals and the land," said Bluett.</p>
        
            <p>On the day he died, Disher volunteered to put up some portable electric fencing, a job he had done well many times before.</p>
        
            <p>Approximately one hour and fifteen minutes after last speaking to Disher, and unable to reach him on the phone, Bluett went in search of him and found Disher lying in a paddock with electric fence standards in his hand.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the efforts of Bluett and Emergency Services, Disher could not be revived.</p>
        
            <p>The paddock where the fence was being put up contained 11kV powerlines on power poles owned by The Lines Company.</p>
        
            <p>A WorkSafe investigation found that reasonable and practical steps on-farm had been taken to limit the hazard, including Bluett inducting new employees on where the powerlines are on the farm, and that the lines are higher than the minimum requirement.</p>
        
            <p>"Following site visits, WorkSafe concluded that Jayden had pulled tension on the electric fence reel between the two high points on either side of the paddock, and the fence tape had either come into contact with the Lines Company 11kV powerline which ran through the gully of the paddock or had been in close enough proximity for the current to arc across," said the coroner's report.</p>
        
            <p>Coroner Schmidt-McCleave accepted WorkSafe's findings and also autopsy results which found the cause of death to be electrocution.</p>
        
            <p>However, the coroner noted that agriculture "is one of New Zealand's most dangerous sectors" and recommended that WorkSafe:</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe New Zealand said it accepted the coroner's recommendations and acknowledged the immense loss suffered by the whānau of Jayden Disher.</p>
        
            <p>"All workers should return home healthy and safe at the end of the day, especially young workers starting their careers," said WorkSafe's area investigation manager Danielle Henry.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe said it has begun work on a safety alert and that safety around powerlines is part of a wider project to develop, maintain, and share guidance so businesses have the information they need to manage their biggest health and safety risks.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe agreed with the coronor's assessment of agriculture as a dangerous sector.</p>
        
            <p>"Since Jayden Disher's death in 2019 a further 82 workers have died in the agricultural sector. That tally includes the 14 workers killed in 2024 alone, which represents almost 40 percent of overall worker fatalities and made agriculture the deadliest industry for workers last year," said Henry.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe said agriculture is one of four priority sectors under WorkSafe's new strategy.</p>
        
            <p>In an obituary after his death, Disher's family said he died working on the land which he loved for 15 years.</p>
        
            <p>"[He was a] beloved son of Craig and Jess. Adored and loved brother of Tyler, Bianca, Keisha and Indy. Cherished grandson of Ian and Ngaire. Nephew of Neville and Susan, and Adrian. Cool cousin to Febe, Lydia, Jack, Lucas, Natasha, Caroline, Izabella and Lexi."</p>
