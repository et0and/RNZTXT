            <p>Police have charged two people with murder after a man was found dead in the middle of an East Auckland road at the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>The man was found at 11.15pm on Saturday on Point England Road.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Detective Senior Sergeant Mark Greaves said the man suffered multiple injuries, and was believed to have been run over by his own vehicle, before it was stolen.</p>
        
            <p>He said the vehicle was recovered on Sunday morning, and was undergoing forensic examination.</p>
        
            <p>A 21-year-old man and a 22-year-old woman both from Auckland were arrested on Monday, Greaves said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Greaves said police would oppose their bail when they appeared in Auckland District Court on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>"These arrests are a positive development, but there's a long way to go in this investigation, and a significant amount of work remains to be completed," he said in a statement.</p>
