            <p>Ruapehu's mayor says he will fight till the end to retain the Chateau Tongariro Hotel after it was revealed it could possibly be decommissioned.</p>
        
            <p>The Chateau was forced to close in February last year after a seismic assessment deemed it "very high risk" with an E-grade earthquake rating.</p>
        
            <p>An Official Information Act request by the New Zealand Herald revealed the Department of Conservation is scrapping plans of expression of interest for parties to operate it.</p>
        
            <p>One option given to DoC from Conservation Minister Tama Potaka was to decommission the 95-year-old neo-Georgian building.</p>
        
            <p>The Herald is reporting decommissioning would cost $1.27 million to board up windows and doors and to shut down systems.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has also requested that OIA information.</p>

            <p>Mayor Weston Kirton said a decommissioning of the hotel would be a massive blow to the community.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that it's 30 percent of our hotel bed nights for the district.</p>
        
            <p>"It's at the high end of accommodation, attracts a lot of people, it brings a lot of employment to town, certainly in the region about $10 million in salaries for example, but there's all the add ons as well."</p>
        
            <p>Kirton is also appalled he was not involved in any talks about scrapping expressions of interest, and should have been because it is a choice that will have massive consequences on livelihoods.</p>
        
            <p>"We're talking something like $30 million to our community here, so I just think it's a situation that's sad.</p>
        
            <p>"We haven't or local iwi, for example, to my knowledge, haven't been party to any of the decision-making and it's been done behind closed doors. In fact it's a situation that probably we need to rectify."</p>
        
            <p>Kirton said a permanent closure will be another huge blow for the community and he knows there are buyers out there who are interested in restoring the Chateau to its original state.</p>
