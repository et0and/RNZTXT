            <p>A paraglider with a passenger had to suddenly land in Queenstown, minutes after taking off, when they faced difficulties.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, police said they were searching for a paraglider reported to be in trouble in Fernhill.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, GForce Paragliding said the pilot and passenger had taken off from the Skyline Gondola but were forced to land in trees on the outskirts of Queenstown about 10.20am.</p>
        
            <p>"They landed safely in a tree behind the residential suburb after the pilot looked for an alternative landing site.</p>
        
            <p>"Police and search and rescue personnel attended and the passenger was airlifted by helicopter, due to terrain accessibility issues, to the nearby Lakes District Hospital for assessment and observation.</p>
        
            <p>"The pilot was uninjured."</p>
        
            <p>The Civil Aviation Authority has been notified. The company said it would carry out its own internal investigation into the incident.</p>
        
            <p>GForce Paragliding co-director Gavin Taylor said the company was fully supporting the passenger and other family members, and would continue collaborating with authorities.</p>
