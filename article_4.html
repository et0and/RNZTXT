            <p>The figure is revealed in the council's latest sensitive expenditure report, which goes before the finance, audit and risk committee next week.</p>
        
            <p>It was a similar amount to that declared for the previous six months.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Neil Holdom racked up the most in expenses.</p>
        
            <p>He spent more than $15,500, including more than $8000 on flights and taxis, and more than $1500 on accommodation.</p>

            <p>The Office of the Auditor General defines sensitive expenditure as "any spending by an organisation that could be seen as giving private benefit to a staff member, their family, or friends".</p>
        
            <p>It encouraged councils to be transparent about such expenses.</p>

            <p>Four councillors - Max Brough, Gordon Brown, Anneka Carlson Matthews and Bali Haque - did not claim expenses or reimbursement for professional development.</p>
        
            <p>Amanda Clinton Gohdes was the only councillor to claim childcare expenses ($2183).</p>

            <p>Graham Chard had the highest expenses of a community board member, raking up more than $4800 in communication costs and milage.</p>
        
            <p>In his role as mayor of New Plymouth Neil Holdom earns $160,000 annually, while councillors with no additional responsibilities earn about $54,000. The Kaitake community board chair receives $15,800 while an ordinary member gets $7900.</p>
