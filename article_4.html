            <p>Police are searching for a man after a woman trying to retrieve her stolen handbag from a car was dragged along 10 metres of pavement at an Auckland mall earlier this month.</p>
        
            <p>The woman was at Glenfield Mall at around 5pm on 1 December when she was pulled to the ground and her handbag was stolen.</p>
        
            <p>The thief ran to his car, a white Toyota Mark-X, and the woman followed.</p>
        
            <p>While trying to retrieve her bag, police say she was dragged by the car for around 10 metres and sustained minor injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Police have released a photo of the man they believe to be the thief and are asking members of the public for help identifying him.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared to be wearing a face-mask pulled down to sit below his mouth and a bucket hat.</p>
