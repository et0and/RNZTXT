        <h2>Patients accuse Pharmac of 'cruelty' and lacking respect</h2>
        <p>
The agency has come under mounting scrutiny in the the last year.

            <p>Some patients and advocacy groups see Pharmac as "slow to respond", "highly defensive" and "lacking respect" for them, according to an independent report released by the drug-funding agency today.</p>
        
            <p>The report - commissioned by Pharmac's board and based on workshops held late last year - found there was "a credibility and trust gap".</p>
        
            <p>Pharmac chair Paula Bennett said it was intended to support its "wider reset" to become "more outward focused".</p>
        
            <p>"We've heard very clearly that we need to make sure our interactions are respectful and meaningful, and that people's voices are valued and included throughout our work," Bennett said.</p>
        
            <p>The agency has come under mounting scrutiny in the the last year, with 100,000 people signing a petition to Parliament in December calling for chief executive Sarah Fitt to be sacked.</p>
        
            <p>She resigned last month after seven years in the top job.</p>
        
            <p>The first workshop in November, chaired by former Wellington mayor Dame Kerry Prendergast, included presentations and personal experiences from 30 participants, who said:</p>
        
            <p>At a second workshop, Paula Bennett and Pharmac management fronted up to respond to questions from the participants at the first workshop.</p>
        
            <p>In her final report, Dame Kerry wrote that "session ended with no real movement on any of the issues discussed".</p>
        
            <p>"The workshop mood was that nothing new was learned from Pharmac's formal responses, and that management had lost an opportunity to be more open / less defensive when dealing with the consumer/patient representatives present."</p>
        
            <p>Following small group discussions, there was universal agreement among workshop participants that Pharmac's Health Technology Assessment (HTA) processes were "flawed" and the model required a complete overhaul rather than "tinkering".</p>
        
            <p>For instance, several participants criticised the fact that as soon as Pharmac received a funding application for a medicine, any new patients were blocked from receiving that medicine under the Named Patient Pharmaceutical Assessment (NPPA) route for that condition.</p>
        
            <p>As one participant noted: "This is a particularly cruel policy that deters submitters from submitting a proposal as this will harm patients. This policy should be overturned with urgency."</p>
        
            <p>The workshops did not come up with a list of prescribed actions that would "reset" Pharmac's relationship with patients, Prendergast wrote.</p>
        
            <p>"Nor did the workshops narrow the 'trust and respect' gap between Pharmac management and many participants.</p>
        
            <p>"That is an incremental process that will require time, tolerance and goodwill on both sides of the table."</p>
        
            <p>However, participants did not want their feedback at the workshops "parked" because they had not managed to come up with specific recommendations, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Dame Kerry has recommended setting up a reference group of up to eight people from the consumer/patient representative community to work in partnership with Pharmac management.</p>
        
            <p>The group's focus could cover:</p>
        
            <p>Paul Bennett said the board had proactively released the report of the workshops to "demonstrate the organisation's commitment to change and being transparent".</p>
        
            <p>"There's a lot for the Board and Pharmac's senior management to think about, and we're considering the next steps. This work is part of a wider reset for Pharmac to become an outward-focused organisation. The team at Pharmac does an amazing job and we're committed to meaningful change to strengthen Pharmac's relationships with consumers."</p>
