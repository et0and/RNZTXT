            <p>Foreign students paid $885 million in fees last year including nearly half-a-billion dollars to universities.</p>
        
            <p>The annual reporting of Export Education Levy statistics showed foreign enrolments doubled in 2023 from a historic low in 2022 but only universities were close to their pre-pandemic levels.</p>
        
            <p>Universities' fee income, $547m, was only a little below the sector's pre-pandemic figure of $580m in 2019 and came from 21,365 students compared to 28,150 students in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>The overall total fee income for all education providers was below the pre-pandemic total of $1.2 billion but nearly double the $483m reported in 2022 when student numbers reached their lowest point as a result of pandemic-related border restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>The annual statistics also indicated that universities' reliance on China as a source country had increased, and that schools had almost entirely recovered their enrolments from Japan but their enrolments from other countries still lagged.</p>
        
            <p>Schools received $114m in foreign student fees last year, nearly double the 2022 total, but lower than the 2019 figure of $202m.</p>
        
            <p>They had 14,125 students, which was about two-thirds their pre-pandemic total.</p>
        
            <p>Secondary schools had more than 3000 students from Japan last year, about the same figure as before the pandemic, but their Chinese enrolments were less than half pre-pandemic totals at 2795.</p>
        
            <p>Te Pūkenga's fee income more than doubled to $91m last year but that figure was just over half its 2019 total of $178m.</p>
        
            <p>It had 8320 foreign students in 2023, nearly half of them from India.</p>
        
            <p>English language schools had 9500 foreign students, less than a third of their 2019 total.</p>
        
            <p>The figures showed most regions had fewer international students last year than in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>However, Hawke's Bay, Gisborne, Taranaki, Manawatū and Whanganui had more, and there were also more foreign students studying extra-murally (4360 last year and 2800 in 2019).</p>
        
            <p>Universities New Zealand chief executive Chris Whelan said universities were "very close" to returning to pre-pandemic international student enrolment levels.</p>
        
            <p>"There's been a very pleasing return of students. The universities are very happy with what they're seeing. Our next big challenge now will be looking at how to spread that student recovery across a few more markets," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The country from which students have come back fastest has been China but like everything we would love to have more than one main market."</p>
        
            <p>Whelan said one of the biggest challenges with new markets was visa and immigration settings related to students' finances.</p>
        
            <p>It was sometimes hard for students from countries such as India to prove that they could support themselves financially, especially if their support came from multiple family members, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Whelan said international students' fees directly contributed to universities' financial viability.</p>
        
            <p>"It's important to remember that without international students the cost of teaching our domestic students would be about 15 percent higher," he said.</p>
