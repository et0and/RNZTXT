            <p>Auckland commuters are facing lengthy delays and bumper-to-bumper traffic following a police incident on the southern motorway.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said emergency services had been responding to an incident near the Penrose Road overbridge.</p>
        
            <p>The motorway was earlier blocked but all lanes have since reopened.</p>
        
            <p>"While the lanes have reopened, there is still significant traffic build-up following the earlier closure, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Motorists should expect continued delays while the traffic build-up clears."</p>
        
            <p>St John said one person has been taken to Auckland City Hospital in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>FINAL UPDATE 6:25PMAll southbound lanes on #SH1 after Ellerslie Panmure Hwy are now OPEN. Allow extra time for long southbound delays to ease. https://t.co/cUlkQQzHIz</p>
