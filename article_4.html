            <p>Police are investigating the conduct of two officers who were filmed twirling around a stripper's pole inside a house.</p>
        
            <p>The home security video, published on the New Zealand Herald's website, showed a woman helping the uniformed officers taking turns on the pole.</p>
        
            <p>The officers appeared to be smiling in the video.</p>
        
            <p>The pair were on duty at the time the video was taken in June, acting Auckland city commander Sunny Patel said.</p>
        
            <p>One of the officers left the force before the police found out about the video, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The other remained on full duties.</p>
