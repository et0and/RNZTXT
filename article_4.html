            <p>Roddy Perez told RNZ he found the Frankton saleyards in commotion and surrounded by police cars when he arrived for a job on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"A steer had got a bit stirred up and managed to jump the wooden rails. It broke several of the rails and got out of the saleyards, and just kept on running. Some people tried to stop it but it got away."</p>
        
            <p>Roddy Perez said it was unusual for stock to escape though there had been an incident last year.</p>
        
            <p>"Apparently this time the cops shot at it, and missed. They hit it in the jaw, so the animal kept on running."</p>
        
            <p>He said the steer made its way about three kilometres to the Hamilton Lake where it damaged some houses.</p>
        
            <p>"Apparently an older man tried to stop it from hitting his daughter but he got knocked over by the steer."</p>
        
            <p>Video on social media shows the steer charging down a suburban road and through an intersection.</p>
        
            <p>Roddy Perez said it was a difficult situation for the police who could not fire off shots in the middle of a residential area easily.</p>
        
            <p>Afterwards, he said many of the agents at the saleyards were shaken up by the escape.</p>
        
            <p>Police returned and checked the yards for safety. They said later they were investigating the runaway.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ reached out to the local office of NZ Farmer but were told they would not be commenting.</p>
