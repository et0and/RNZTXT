            <p>Heavy rain is on the cards for western and central parts of the North Island today, with heavy snow forecast for much of the South Island on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said a heavy rain watch was in place for Waikato southwest of Te Awamutu, Waitomo, Taumarunui, western Taupō, Taihape and North Taranaki including the mountain from 9am Saturday to 2am Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>"A front moves slowly northeast over the North Island today," it said.</p>
        
            <p>In the South Island, a heavy snow watch was in place for South Canterbury, Queenstown Lakes and Central Otago.</p>
        
            <p>"During Sunday, a front will move slowly northeast over the lower South Island, preceded by moist northwesterlies and followed by a much colder southeast flow," MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>"The front is expected to bring another period of significant snow."</p>
        
            <p>And the latest Road Snowfall Warnings have been issued also, covering Sunday and Monday with the expected snowfall ❄@nztamain ⬅ for current road conditions pic.twitter.com/CH47NDzM4l</p>
        
            <p>MetService warned people to prepare for snow, cold temperatures, and possible power outages.</p>
        
            <p>"If you must travel, drive cautiously, and ensure you have snow chains, sleeping bags, warm clothing and emergency items."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week, MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said farmers with young stock could be affected by the snow.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland, showers were expected to turn to rain this afternoon, possibly heavy.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington would also be mostly cloudy with isolated showers, turning to scattered rain this afternoon and evening.</p>
        
            <p>In the South Island, Christchurch could expect light rain, easing to one or two showers by afternoon but remaining mostly cloudy.</p>
        
            <p>And further south in Invercargill, the weather looked fine apart from evening cloud.</p>
        
            <p>However, next week the chilly weather was set to continue with Makgabutlane saying parts of the country "might find ourselves reaching for those cozy jumpers".</p>
