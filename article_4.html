        <h2>Adoption centre offers hope to forgotten dogs</h2>
        <p>
The first dog adoption centre in South Auckland is offering a new leash on life to abandoned and forgotten canines in the region.

            <p>The Pukekohe Adoption and Education Centre opened in March to ease the pressure on Auckland Council's other shelters in Manukau, Henderson and Silverdale which were almost always at capacity.</p>
        
            <p>Less than half of roaming dogs in the region were reclaimed by their owners last year - the lowest level in a decade.</p>
        
            <p>The Pukekohe centre takes in unclaimed dogs from the council's three animal shelters, to train and prepare them for forever homes.</p>
        
            <p>Senior shelter operations Kayleigh Hatcher said since they opened for adoptions in January, they've successfully rehomed 12 dogs.</p>
        
            <p>The centre officially opened on 15 March.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a seven-day claim at the other shelters, if no one claims them, they become council property," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"They are temperament tested, and if they are suitable, they come through to us for training and adoption."</p>
        
            <p>The Pukekohe centre currently has 27 dogs, and could take up to 40, Hatcher said.</p>

            <p>The centre opened to take the pressure off the other shelters which were kept busy with roaming dogs.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 January to 26 March, 4512 roaming dogs were reported to the council's Animal Management, of which, 1509 were impounded.</p>
        
            <p>West had the most number of roaming dogs (1009) and Central (903).</p>
        
            <p>East Auckland had the most number of impounded dogs for this period (435).</p>
        
            <p>"We give them a lot of support, a lot of training, we spend a lot of time with the dogs.</p>
        
            <p>"We also make sure that homes they are adopted into is the best suitable ones for them."</p>
        
            <p>The centre's newest canines were a litter of four puppies from Silverdale - who were relinquished by their owner.</p>
        
            <p>They were named Roast Vegetables by the centre, individually called Kumara, Pumpkin, Potato and Radish.</p>
        
            <p>Hatcher said all their dogs start with basic training, then once fully vaccinated, go for walks out in public.</p>
        
            <p>"The centre solely focuses on training and nurturing the dogs for adoption.</p>
        
            <p>"We also have a shelter cat that will spend time with them, so they can get used to cats."</p>
        
            <p>Shelter manager Carly Triska said the council's shelters do amazing work caring for the dogs.</p>
        
            <p>"But unfortunately, they're also looking after dogs that have been impounded, looking after dogs that have been found roaming and aggressive dogs," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The adoption centre is set up to help create a little bit more space at those shelters they can now hold more of those dogs that need to be off the streets."</p>
