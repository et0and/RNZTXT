But the council is not ruling out further odour problems during planned remediation at the site.

            <p>The Christchurch City Council has settled its long-awaited Bromley Wastewater Plant insurance claim, although it is not ruling out further odour problems during planned remediation at the site.</p>
        
            <p>Local authorities have confirmed it has received an $85 million insurance settlement, almost three years after a fire destroyed two trickling filters at the plant.</p>
        
            <p>A lingering "unbearable" stench, as a result of the November 2021 fire, left locals in Bromley and neighbouring suburbs battling nausea, headaches, worsening asthma, sleepless nights and deteriorating mental health.</p>
        
            <p>A temporary system was put in place, although this did little to allay the odour.</p>
        
            <p>The problems were on top of existing gripes about a separate odour linked to the nearby organics processing plant.</p>
        
            <p>The filters are set to be replaced over the next three years with an activated sludge reactor system with provisional estimates sitting at $140m.</p>
        
            <p>According to the council, sludge reactors are a prominent treatment process globally and the best wastewater treatment method from a resilience and cost perspective.</p>

            <p>During Wednesday's announcement, council chief executive Mary Richardson told media the additional $55m needed for the project was included in council's existing budgets.</p>
        
            <p>"We do have funding in the long term plan," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There'll be no additional cost on ratepayers.</p>
        
            <p>"We have planned for that cost."</p>
        
            <p>However, leaders and council staff could not guarantee that further odour problems wouldn't persist as the filters were replaced.</p>
        
            <p>Council's head of three waters Gavin Hutchison said it had procedures in place to "minimise the risk of odour".</p>
        
            <p>"The plant is at capacity and we're doing a lot of work to ensure nothing falls over and resolve any odours being created," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The risk is there and we'll continue to do our best to to ensure that doesn't happen."</p>

            <p>Christchurch Mayor Phil Mauger said community leaders owed it to residents to remove what is left of the aged filters and construct a more modern system.</p>
        
            <p>"The trickling filters are 50 years old, and in that time technology has moved forward in leaps and bounds.</p>
        
            <p>"This new activated sludge system will provide us with the opportunity to significantly reduce emissions and has a smaller footprint that can be upsized at a lower cost to accommodate our growing population,"</p>
        
            <p>The insurance settlement was unanimously approved by elected members after delays and "complex negotiations" stalled progress.</p>
        
            <p>Richardson said the insurer was willing to cover the cost for an equivalent filter system replacement.</p>
        
            <p>"We have been very fortunate that we've been able to negotiate with our insurance company to get a cash settlement, which we weren't automatically entitled to, that enabled us to build a far better solution," she said.</p>
        
            <p>A 2022 report by Fire and Emergency investigators revealed the fire most likely started when contractors accidentally ignited maintenance tape or the fibreglass roof of one of the trickling tanks with a heating tool.</p>
        
            <p>Investigators had been unable to determine exactly how the fire broke out because Goleman Group contractors had declined to be interviewed.</p>
        
            <p>Richardson refused to comment on Wednesday when RNZ asked who was ultimately liable for the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"That's something we can't comment on at this stage," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Detailed design on the project is still being finalised with construction slated to begin within the next six months.</p>
        
            <p>The sludge reactor system is expected up and running by late-2027.</p>
        
            <p>An independent report, commissioned by the council last year, showed the council's response was inadequate, particularly how it addressed welfare concerns for affected residents.</p>
        
            <p>Both Mauger and then chief executive Dawn Baxendale apologised over how the event was handled.</p>
