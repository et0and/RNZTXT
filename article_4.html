            <p>Council officials have closed part of a main street in the South Island town of Fairlie because of what the say is a severe risk of asbestos contamination from a burnt out building.</p>
        
            <p>The fish and chip shop on Riddle Street was extensively damaged on Monday and the Mackenzie District Council now says it contains asbestos.</p>
        
            <p>It has closed a section of the street as well as a children's playground and the public toilets, and will start testing on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>It would focus on areas around the nearby businesses and council staff were also wetting down shop fronts and the street to reduce the number of any airborne particles.</p>
        
            <p>High winds on Thursday afternoon stirred up residue from the fire and more wind was forecast overnight.</p>
        
            <p>The results of the tests would be known by later today or early Saturday.</p>
