            <p>A dengue fever outbreak will be officially declared on Friday in Samoa.</p>
        
            <p>More than 250 cases have been reported, with the majority on the mainland, northwest of Upolu, where most of the population lives.</p>
        
            <p>The World Health Organisation describes denge fever as a viral infection that spreads from mosquitoes to people. Most people don't get symptims but for those who the most common were high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and rash.</p>
        
            <p>Samoa's Director General of Health Alec Ekeroma says a news conference will be held in Samoa at 4pm local time (3pm NZT).</p>
        
            <p>Earlier he said: "No one has died from it, but the country needs to continue its protection measures, and we are planning a national campaign to clean up and destroy breeding sites for mosquitos."</p>
        
            <p>Samoa's last dengue situation report dated March 18 - 24 showed 22 new lab-confirmed dengue cases recorded at the time, adding up to 40 cases in March.</p>
        
            <p>The report noted the most affected age groups were those between 5-9 years old and those over 60.</p>
        
            <p>Northwest of Upolu and Apia urban area regions are reported to be the most affected, but some cases have been reported from all regions including Savai'i.</p>
        
            <p>Aiono said there were 20 different definitions of outbreak and they would decide which definition applied now.</p>
        
            <p>If someone has symptoms of dengue-like illness, Aiono said they have to go to hospital so they can undergo blood tests to confirm if they do have dengue.</p>
        
            <p>A public health alert on dengue fever has already been issued advising and encouraging clinicians to collect samples for testing for all patients presenting with dengue-like illnesses.</p>
