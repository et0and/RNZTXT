            <p>There have been seven confirmed cases of mpox in Auckland since late December, including one case who has since returned home overseas.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Regional Public Health Service specialist Dr Felicity Williamson said mpox was a viral infection spread through skin-to-skin contact.</p>
        
            <p>She said the risk of catching it was low, but those with a skin rash, bumps, blisters or sores should seek health advice.</p>
        
            <p>Williamson said contact tracing had identified links between most of the cases, confirming the virus has spread.</p>
        
            <p>The current global outbreak began in May 2022, when the virus - then known as 'monkeypox' - turned up in London. The World Health Organization later that year renamed it 'mpox', saying its former name prompted "racist and stigmatising language".</p>
        
            <p>The WHO declared the global public health emergency over in May 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The first human case was detected in 1970 in Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
