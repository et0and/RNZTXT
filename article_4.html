In an open letter to the government, they said a third of the free budgeting services are losing funding, putting more pressure on poor communities.

            <p>Budgeting services that face closure after missing out on government money this year are pleading for an urgent review of the sector's funding.</p>
        
            <p>In an open letter to the prime minister and ministers, they said a third of the free budgeting services - 44 - are losing government funding, putting more pressure on poor communities.</p>
        
            <p>The letter has 62 signatories, representing 57 different budgeting services across the country, some of whose current contract ends on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Central Budgeting general manager Teresa White said they feared that desperate whānau would be left hanging and were concerned that some communities would be left without a budgeting service.</p>
        
            <p>"There is a risk that we will lose experienced financial mentors, and with them the knowledge they have, and that is a worry for our sector and the communities we serve," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin Budget Advisory Service had lost its government funding.</p>
        
            <p>Its executive officer Andrew Henderson said that meant it had become unviable.</p>
        
            <p>"It is unclear if we are being replaced by a new provider or whether they have experienced financial mentors. Where do we refer people? I am deeply concerned about the impact that this process will have on the Dunedin community," Henderson said.</p>
        
            <p>Budget advisors are also asking the government to increase the overall funding for the sector.</p>
        
            <p>The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) said funding for budgeting services has dropped from just over $22 million last year to $19.5m from July, due to the expiry of a time-limited cash boost during the pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>It is also changing the funding model from covering sessions to employees - around 180 financial mentors will be funded nationally.</p>
        
            <p>That meant MSD would no longer fund 44 of the current 132 budgeting services.</p>
        
            <p>White said the collective of budgeting services was concerned funding would drastically reduce the number of financial mentors - currently 800 mentors across the country in varying part-time and full-time roles.</p>
        
            <p>It also came as the number of whānau turning to financial mentors for help jumped 40 percent in a year as they grapple with growing debt, according to a report.</p>
        
            <p>The second annual FinCap Voices report has laid out the financial wellbeing of those supported by financial mentors.</p>
        
            <p>The 185 services across Aotearoa worked with 49,568 whānau in 2022, but that leapt to 69,807 in 2023, the report showed.</p>
        
            <p>White said Auckland Central Budgeting's client numbers had more than doubled since 2021.</p>
        
            <p>"We have had to take on more staff to meet demand, people are doing it really tough out there, the impacts of Covid-19 are still filtering through, add high interest rates, a recession, and the current cost of living, you get a perfect storm," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The cost of living weighed heavily on people with stretched budgets - Dunedin Budget Advisory Service said almost half of the people contacting their service were facing such pressure.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't see this issue going away anytime soon. It is essential that our community can reach out for support and receive help in a timely and safe manner," Henderson said.</p>
