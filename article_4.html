            <p>More cancer patients are waiting too long for potentially life-saving radiation treatment.</p>
        
            <p>Advocates say some breast cancer patients are waiting weeks longer than best practice, putting them at risk of the disease recurring.</p>
        
            <p>Lucy - not her real name - had her breast tumour picked up by her first-ever mammogram in March, the week before her 40th birthday.</p>
        
            <p>She had surgery at Gisborne Hospital to remove the tumour on 24 April, and was then referred to Waikato for radiation treatment.</p>
        
            <p>"The general sort of consensus is they couldn't give me any clarity on dates," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"It probably would have started at the end of July. There's a recommended time-frame of 12 weeks, so that would have put me just outside that time-frame."</p>
        
            <p>Lucy, who has three young children and a business, started radiotherapy at a private hospital in Wellington last week, paid for by insurance.</p>
        
            <p>"I feel like they're more in touch with my notes and my medical history. They kind of speak to me as a person, not just 'cancer'."</p>
        
            <p>Another breast cancer patient, in her mid-50s, paid privately for a biopsy to avoid the 6-8 week wait to get diagnosed in the public system over the Christmas period.</p>
        
            <p>"If I had continued privately it was going to cost up to $80,000, so I opted to go back into the public system."</p>
        
            <p>She had surgery in March but was told to expect to wait 10-12 weeks for radiotherapy.</p>
        
            <p>She waited 16 weeks.</p>
        
            <p>"I was anxious for those 16 weeks - it's cancer, not a cold - and any time you hear it, it's not good.</p>
        
            <p>"When I put it to radiologist why it was taking so long, he said he didn't have an explanation for it, they were just short-staffed and that was it'"</p>
        
            <p>Breast Cancer Foundation chief executive Ah-Leen Rayner said international best practice was for women who have had breast-conserving surgery to get radiation treatment within 8-12 weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Longer delays can as much as double the chance of breast cancer coming back.</p>
        
            <p>"Women particularly in the Waikato are facing long delays particularly to radiation treatment, but that's elsewhere as well. There's a shortage of machines, a shortage of therapists."</p>
        
            <p>A recent report by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists showed the number of full-time specialists has risen nine percent in the past decade - but this was outstripped by a 29 percent rise in treatments.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Dunedin Hospital lost its accreditation to train new radiation oncologists after it was left with just three specialists instead of eight.</p>
        
            <p>Christchurch-based radiation oncologist Melissa James, who is on the college's New Zealand committee, said the government had upped the number of trainees in the past few years - but it would take time to turn around a decade of under-investment.</p>
        
            <p>"We need urgent action to make sure we don't have a collapse, a spreading collapse of radiation oncology across the country."</p>
        
            <p>About half of all cancer patients could benefit from radiation therapy, yet several business cases to build more machines to deliver that therapy had stalled, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are desperately wanting to get that to patients when they need it and we are very much aware that often that isn't possible.</p>
        
            <p>"And that's very hard on patients both psychologically and sometimes in terms of cancer outcomes. So as a clinician, that's really tough."</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand's latest quarterly report shows cancer wait times have worsened, with more than 18 percent of patients waiting longer than a month to start any treatment, in the first three months of this year.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand has been approached for comment.</p>
