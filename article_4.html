            <p>A courtroom, a lifeguard tower, a lifesaving tower and a bridge are among the homes and workplaces recognised in the 2023 New Zealand Architecture Awards held tonight in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Judging panel convenor Dave Strachan said an increase in entries and a very high standard meant that deciding the winners was tough. The panel undertook a nationwide tour of each short-listed project.</p>
        
            <p>"Judging quality architecture is not an exact science and is fraught with the challenge of how to objectively assess a varying range of projects in many categories but in the end, we were unanimous in our decisions and came to them pretty quickly," Strachan said.</p>
        
            <p>A refit of the Whangārei Māori Land Court, Te Kooti Whenua Māori by GHD Design and Studio Pasifika was recognised in the Interior Architecture section. Judges said the design showed how changes in an institution's kaupapa can be reflected in its architecture.</p>

            <p>"The design is centred on the principles of mahi toi (art and craft), ahi kā (continuous occupation), tohu (guidance), and whakapapa (ancestry), and integrates modern architecture with traditional Māori elements. The interior spatial design addresses issues of hierarchy by fostering a sense of equity, participation and inclusion.</p>
        
            <p>"The design successfully merges traditional craft with modern technology, making the courtroom approachable and accessible while also fostering dialogue and addressing past relationships."</p>
        
            <p>The John Scott Award for Public Architecture went to Te Pae, a tiny lifesaving tower in north Piha, designed by Crosson Architects and largely built using gifted materials and labour from the local community. Te Pae was also recognised in the Small Project Architecture category.</p>

            <p>"Sometimes functional and pragmatic buildings can elicit a business-as-usual architectural response. This is anything but," judges said.</p>
        
            <p>"A very functional and safe spiral staircase leads to the cantilevered watch house, its operable ribbon windows, like a pair of wrap-around westie sunglasses, providing views up and down North Piha's rugged surf coast."</p>
        
            <p>An "elegant upgrade" of Ngā Hau Māngere - Old Māngere Bridge in south Auckland earned Bossley Architects the sole award in the Planning and Urban Design category.</p>

            <p>Judges said the bridge, which is now a community destination, is a "successful marriage of community-engaged design and engineering".</p>
        
            <p>The Sir Miles Warren Award for Commercial Architecture went to The Great Glenorchy Alpine Basecamp, a group of 14 gable-roofed sleeping huts and adjacent communal spaces designed by RTA Studio and Bureaux Architecture. The Glenorchy project was also awarded in the Hospitality section.</p>

            <p>Judges praised the design and buildings for taking a "softer" approach to tourism that suits the surrounding environment.</p>
        
            <p>"The experiences here for tourists are not offering hospitality with a high demand in terms of energy and resource use. The low-impact buildings and site services offer delightfully simple sleeping huts rather than a high-end hotel, something which suggests visitors who book an experience here are much more in tune with the spirit of the place."</p>
        
            <p>A building on a Wellington waterfront site initially thought to be too small to be developed received one of two awards for Commercial architecture. Judges said that Site 9 Kumutoto, by Athfield Architects, was a "standout example of a response to a difficult site with architectural ingenuity and sensitive urban design".</p>

</p>
        
            <p>"The design also overcame complex site conditions and planning constraints, which challenged the team, making the result even more successful. The project also excels in material durability, clever internal planning, and a well-thought-out interface with public realms, making it a notable addition to Wellington's evolving waterfront landscape," judges said.</p>
        
            <p>The Ted McCoy Award for Education went to Architectus for their transformative rebuild of Te Aratai College in east Christchurch. The former Linwood College, which was also recognised in the Education category, "is a beacon of community engagement and educational innovation," judges said.</p>

            <p>"Carefully planned through deep community consultation and withan emphasis on cultural significance, this exceptional project stands as a testimony to overcoming adversity and empowering future generations."</p>
        
            <p>Wellington architect Mary Daish was recognised in the Housing - Alterations and Additions category for her work on a Kelburn villa.</p>
        
            <p>
Judges said Mary Daish's redesign of this Kelburn villa was handled by the architect in an extremely skilful way.
