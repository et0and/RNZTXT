            <p>A body found on a beach on Auckland's west coast is believed to be that of a missing swimmer.</p>
        
            <p>Police were notified a body had washed up on Bethells Beach on Friday night, likely to be of a man who got into difficulty in the water at Piha on Tuesday evening.</p>
        
            <p>The man's family has been advised, and the death will be referred to the coroner.</p>
        
            <p>Formal identification was yet to take place.</p>
        
            <p>A group of swimmers got into difficulty just after 4pm on Tuesday. Police said five swimmers were rescued and a sixth member of the group could not be located.</p>
        
            <p>A search involving air patrols came up empty.</p>
