            <p>An advocacy group says an official Dunedin marketing video showing a sea lion being "actively disturbed" by a beach rugby game should be taken down.</p>
        
            <p>The video, part of Enterprise Dunedin's new marketing campaign, has been roundly criticised online since being posted to the Dunedin NZ Facebook page yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Sea Lion Trust trustee Chloe Barker said the video needed to be taken down ''as soon as possible''.</p>
        
            <p>It was disappointing to see a council organisation publishing material showing a sea lion being disturbed, she said.</p>
        
            <p>''We work really, really hard to try and educate the public about how to interact with Dunedin's wildlife.</p>
        
            <p>''It just kind of feels like it undoes a little bit of the good work and the efforts that not only the trust but the whole community has been behind.''</p>

            <p>The video, which was part of a campaign designed to attract Australia tourists to Dunedin, could give people the wrong idea of how to interact with wildlife.</p>
        
            <p>''When you have people coming from outside of Dunedin or outside of New Zealand, then it's particularly important that what we're portraying is a sustainable way of interacting with our wildlife,'' Barker said.</p>
        
            <p>''We completely understand how exciting it is to see a sea lion, because no matter how many times you see a sea lion, you still get excited by it.</p>
        
            <p>''But we'd really like to see a promotion that helps to leave them in peace.</p>
        
            <p>''You can see that the sea lion actually reacts and has been disturbed during that whole filming process.''</p>
        
            <p>She was pleased the public had recognised issues with the ad and hoped it would ''disappear off the internet''.</p>
        
            <p>''We'd like to see the ad taken down as soon as possible, the worst thing that can happen is it getting shared.''</p>
        
            <p>The video shows a sea lion rising and moving towards the players, who run away as the marine mammal approaches.</p>
        
            <p>The sea lion trust said it had not been engaged with during the making of the video, as was common during previous shoots.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin City Council has been approached for comment.</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin city councillor Steve Walker raised concerns about the campaign earlier this month, pointing out that the touch rugby players appeared to be too close to the sea lion.</p>
        
            <p>Commenters on the Dunedin NZ Facebook page described the video as "appalling messaging" which encouraged beachgoers to play around sea lions.</p>
        
            <p>This story was first published by the Otago Daily Times.</p>
