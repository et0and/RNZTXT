            <p>Police will continue a scene examination of a Canterbury property where remains believed to be missing Christchurch woman Yanfei Bao were found.</p>
        
            <p>The discovery was made on Tuesday morning during a police search along a treeline on private farmland in the Greenpark area in the Selwyn district.</p>
        
            <p>The search involved a team of 60 staff after police received information that led to a "specific location of interest".</p>

            <p>The remains were found in a shallow grave about 150mm deep, according to police.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Nicola Reeves said she was "comfortable" police had found Bao.</p>
        
            <p>A post mortem was due to take place on Wednesday, with results likely to take a few days.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, police would remain at the Greenpark property today forensically examining the area for any other possible items of interest.</p>
        
            <p>In a police statement on Wednesday, Reeves thanked the dedicated team of staff that achieved this result.</p>
        
            <p>"Bringing Yanfei home is what we set out to do, and we are confident that we have succeeded in that," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"This brings a range of emotions, but mainly relief that we can finish this chapter for Yanfei's loved ones and give them a sense of peace.</p>
        
            <p>"Yanfei's family are now processing this news and taking time to come to terms with the information."</p>
        
            <p>A 53-year-old Chinese national, Tingjun Cao, was accused of her kidnapping and murder, with a trial date scheduled for October.</p>
        
            <p>Police were not seeking anybody else in connection to Bao's murder.</p>
        
            <p>A Christchurch city councillor hopes the discovery of remains after a year-long search will bring closure.</p>
