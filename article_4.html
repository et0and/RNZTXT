            <p>Police are appealing for information after a pedestrian was hospitalised following a crash at a car meet in North Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the intersection of Beatties Rd and Upper Sefton Rd in Ashley about 2.20am on Saturday morning, where a person had sustained serious injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John responded by sending one ambulance to the scene and transported one person, a pedestrian, to Christchurch Hospital in a serious condition.</p>
        
            <p>Police said inquiries were ongoing to locate the driver and determine the circumstances of the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Chris Lynch Media reported an 18-year-old man was injured after being struck by a ute at a car meet, leaving him unconscious.</p>
        
            <p>The teenager's aunt told Chris Lynch Media he had since been released from hospital and faced a lengthy recovery from a concussion, but did not suffer any broken bones.</p>
        
            <p>A video shared with Chris Lynch Media reportedly shows the ute performing a burnout before striking the pedestrian with the rear of the vehicle, causing them to flip, before the driver flees the scene.</p>
