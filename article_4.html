            <p>The frontman of award-winning New Zealand rock band The Feelers has been sentenced after he was caught driving at double the speed limit and refusing to provide a blood sample.</p>
        
            <p>James Reid was sentenced to 12 months supervision and disqualified from driving for a year and a day in the Christchurch District Court today.</p>
        
            <p>The 50-year-old was seen by police driving at speeds of between 90 and 100 km/h in a 50 km/h zone on Christchurch's Harewood Road at about 2.20am on Boxing Day.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the patrol car's flashing lights, Reid failed to stop.</p>
        
            <p>After stopping outside his home, Reid provided two insufficient breath alcohol samples. The officer then asked for a blood sample, which Reid refused.</p>
        
            <p>He said he did not stop for the officer as he did not think police were stopping him.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Ian Mill also fined Reid $1000 and ordered that he pay court costs of $130.</p>
        
            <p>Reid was also convicted of refusing to give a blood sample in 2017.</p>
        
            <p>Defence lawyer Rupert Ward said it had been a "challenging time" for his client, who had struggled with alcohol for much of his life.</p>
        
            <p>"The only real reason he has come into contact with the court system is as a result of the disease that is alcoholism," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"He has very bravely faced up to the problems he's been facing."</p>
        
            <p>The court heard that Reid had voluntarily admitted himself into a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre on the outskirts of Christchurch, completing a three-month residential programme.</p>
        
            <p>"James has demonstrated a genuine and considered approach to his time at [the facility]," Ward said.</p>
        
            <p>Reid had also signed up for a further 32-week follow up programme.</p>
        
            <p>"He very much regrets his offending.</p>
        
            <p>"He's shocked at his own stupidity."</p>
        
            <p>In his sentencing remarks, Judge Mill said Reid had been highly dependent on alcohol "for some time".</p>
        
            <p>"The probation officer said there is a low risk of you re-offending if you continue on this path," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"You've drunk regularly since the age of 20.</p>
        
            <p>"No doubt you've had times in the past where you've tried to address the problem."</p>
        
            <p>Reid is a founding member of Christchurch band The Feelers, who have released six studio albums since the late 1990s.</p>
        
            <p>Three of their albums - Supersystem, Communicate, One World - peaked at #1 on the official NZ Music chart.</p>
        
            <p>The Feelers received a New Zealand Music award for their single 'Pressure Man' and an APRA Silver Scroll for the most played song on radio with second single 'Supersystem'.</p>
        
            <p>The band was also awarded the most played song on New Zealand Radio in consecutive years, with 'Supersystem' in 1998 and 'Venus' the following year.</p>
        
            <p>Reid also released his solo album Saint in 2013.</p>
