            <p>Northland shearer Toa Henderson has become the first debut finalist to win the Golden Shears Open in 15 years.</p>
        
            <p>The Kaiwaka-based 34-year-old won Saturday night's competition "with remarkable comfort", Shearing Sports New Zealand spokesperson Doug Laing said.</p>
        
            <p>Henderson defeated defending champion Leon Samuels, eight-times winner Rowland Smith, four-times winner John Kirkpatrick and 2015 victor Gavin Mutch.</p>
        
            <p>He sheared 20 sheep in 16 minutes, 15.779s, beating Wairarapa hope David Buick by eight seconds.</p>

            <p>"I've been dreaming of this since I was this high," Henderson said. "I used to dream of this moment. To come off first and hold the trophy means more to me than anything."</p>
        
            <p>Joel Henare claimed his 11th consecutive Golden Shears Open woolhandling title.</p>
