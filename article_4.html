            <p>Househunters are being offered $500 grocery vouchers or a free week's rent by Auckland landlords keen to lure them - but are being told to hold off for more.</p>
        
            <p>TradeMe statistics showed the number of new rental listings in the city in February was up 34 percent on the same time last year - from 8049 to 10,805.</p>
        
            <p>Aspire Property Management managing director Mike Atkinson said the market was like musical chairs.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment there are a lot more chairs than there are people playing the game so it's a lot easier to get a seat," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Aspire had about 1000 properties on its books, most of them in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Atkinson had noticed more little sweeteners enter the mix.</p>
        
            <p>"Food vouchers, like Countdown vouchers for $500, we have a couple of properties at the moment offering one week's free rent. That's particularly common amongst apartments," he said.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ also found properties on Trade Me advertising two weeks free rent, and several houses that had dropped their weekly rent by up to $60 a week.</p>
        
            <p>Atkinson said would-be tenants would probably be better off in the long term by negotiating a lower weekly rent.</p>
        
            <p>"If you find a property that you think is a nice property, that you'd like to live but its $20 a week more than you think you can afford to pay, then definitely put an offer in to the agent or landlord," he said.</p>
        
            <p>One of the biggest things landlords could do to help get tenants was to allow pets, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Atkinson said "new listings" figures did not tell the full story because many homes were are sitting empty for longer than they were a year ago, further increasing the pool, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Figures Aspire used, showed and an almost 60 percent increase in available rentals in South Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Those working in property said there was a mix of reasons - including Aucklanders moving overseas, moving back in with their parents, or putting their own homes up for rent when they could not sell them.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ visited a Mount Roskill viewing to ask house hunters what they were seeing.</p>
        
            <p>Prashitesh and Palvi were searching for a family home and had noticed some of the incentives but they were not enough to lure them.</p>
        
            <p>"Either its not the area we want, or its not the type of house we want," Palvi said.</p>
        
            <p>Flat hunter Parush, who was looking with two flatmates, noticed there was a lot more choice than when he last looked two years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"We've already looked at 20-25 houses so it good, there are lots of options," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Latest figures from realestate.co.nz showed the growing renters market might be having an impact on weekly rents.</p>
        
            <p>The average rental Auckland in February fell four percent on the previous year to $689 a week.</p>
        
            <p>But Zac Thomas, the president of advocacy group Renters United, said talk of a renters market was not all it seemed to be.</p>
        
            <p>There was still a power imbalance that meant very few renters were negotiating cheaper prices, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are a renter that knows about these statistics then, great, there are the odd instances, but its not something we are seeing across the board," he said.</p>
        
            <p>His advice to renters who did get a good price was to lock it in their contract for as long as possible.</p>
