            <p>A man has been charged in relation to the death of Neville Thomson who was killed by a dog in PƒÅnguru, Northland, last year.</p>
        
            <p>Thomson was found dead on 4 August, 2022.</p>
        
            <p>When his body was found police and animal control rounded up 25 neo mastiff crosses and bulldog crosses outside and took them to Far North District Council's animal shelter.</p>
        
            <p>Another dog outside was shot at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>Three aggressive dogs escaped but were also found and put down.</p>
        
            <p>Far North area investigations manager detective senior sergeant Chris Fouhy says a 59-year-old man has been charged with "owns dog which causes injury or death".</p>
        
            <p>The man is due to appear in the Kaitaia District Court on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>It had been a challenging investigation, Fouhy said, and he hoped the arrest reassured Thomson's family.</p>
