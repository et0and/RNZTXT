            <p>Northland police are appealing for information after a person died on State Highway 12 near Tane Mahuta this morning.</p>
        
            <p>A man was found at 8.47am seriously injured next to the road, about 4km south of Waimamaku, and passed away a short time later, police said.</p>
        
            <p>Police had done a scene examination and interviewed a number of people in relation to the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"Through our enquiries, a nearby property has been secured and police have seized a 2024 white double cab Toyota Hilux Utility, with a large black Bull Bar on the front and a flat deck on the back."</p>
        
            <p>They had spoken to a "person of interest" already, but were calling for witnesses in the area at the time to call police, especially anyone who might have dashcam footage or who saw someone walking on the road.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information could call 105 or visit the police 105 website.</p>
