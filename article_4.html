            <p>One of the men charged as being a party to Auckland dairy worker Janak Patel's murder has been granted a stay in proceedings as he is terminally ill.</p>
        
            <p>On Wednesday, Justice Graham Lang said the court had received notice from the solicitor-general staying the proceeding for Henry Fred.</p>
        
            <p>The solicitor-general may, at any time after a person has been charged with an offence and before judgment is given, direct that the proceedings be stayed.</p>
        
            <p>A stay in proceedings is a ruling by the court, stopping further proceedings in a trial.</p>
        
            <p>Janak Patel was looking after the Sandringham dairy when he was fatally stabbed.</p>
        
            <p>Last month, Frederick Hobson pleaded guilty to Patel's murder. Patel's sister told Stuff no family should have to suffer like they did.</p>
        
            <p>On the evening of 23 November 2022, Patel and his wife were working at the Rose Cottage Superette in Sandringham, central Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Court documents released to Stuff say there was a plan for Hobson to enter the shop armed with a knife to take the cash from the till and any other items he could manage.</p>
        
            <p>At 7.55pm, Hobson, holding a brown paper bag, entered a telephone booth outside the dairy. He pretended to be on the phone while vehicles and members of the public passed the dairy.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson then pulled a black bandana up to cover up the bottom half of his face and ran into the dairy holding a knife and a brown paper bag.</p>
        
            <p>He ran behind the counter, forcing his way through two closed wooden panels and approached the till.</p>
        
            <p>Patel's wife saw Hobson and ran through a back door to escape. Patel stepped out of that room and was confronted with Hobson holding the knife.</p>

            <p>Patel retreated as Hobson picked up a cash register and grabbed a number of items from the immediate area.</p>
        
            <p>He left the dairy and walked in a "calm and casual" manner towards Duncan Ave.</p>
        
            <p>Patel grabbed a hockey stick and ran after Hobson.</p>
        
            <p>About 150m from the dairy, Hobson put the cash register into a wheelie bin, but heard Patel coming behind him.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson picked up a large tree branch and aggressively advance towards Patel, holding the knife and the tree branch.</p>
        
            <p>Patel retreated and swung the hockey stick.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson waited for Patel to swing the hockey stick again, dropped the tree branch and lunged towards Patel with a knife, pushing him onto the ground on his back.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson leant over, held Patel down and stabbed him three times in quick succession.</p>
        
            <p>He then attempted to wrench the hockey stick from Patel's grasp, but Patel managed to get onto his feet.</p>
        
            <p>Hobson then stabbed Patel a further three times, the final blow was to his neck.</p>
        
            <p>At this point, Patel moved around the wheelie bin in an attempt to get away, but Hobson attempted to stab him again.</p>
        
            <p>Patel collapsed after taking five steps towards the dairy. He was bleeding profusely from his various stab wounds and died a short time later. The fatal wounds included the left-hand side of his chest and the other to his back.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Hobson collected the wheelie bin and continued walking casually along the road.</p>
        
            <p>He retrieved the cash register and left the wheelie bin on the pavement before changing his clothes and getting into a car.</p>
        
            <p>The death of Patel rocked the Sandringham community. Dozens of flowers and keepsakes were left in front of the Rose Cottage Superette.</p>
