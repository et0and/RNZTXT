            <p>A Northland High School was put into lockdown for an hour after fighting broke out and parents went onto school grounds.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to Kaitāia College at about 1.30pm on Wednesday in response to a report of a person trespassing on the school grounds, a police spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>At 2pm, a message posted on social media from the school said the college was in lockdown and urged parents not to come to the school or phone in.</p>
        
            <p>"This may cause disruption to the management of this incident and could potentially place yourselves and our staff and student's safety at risk," the post said.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly before 3pm, the school came out of lockdown and the college confirmed all students, staff and people who were on-site had been safely accounted for.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone did extremely well and responded to instructions."</p>
        
            <p>It said parents and caregivers of students would be given a notice on Wednesday evening to provide more information on what happened at the school.</p>
        
            <p>"Officers are no longer present - the person trespassing left prior to police arrival," Police have said.</p>
