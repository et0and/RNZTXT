            <p>Hawke's Bay Regional Council is commissioning an external review into last week's devastating flood in Wairoa following the controversial decision not to open the river mouth sooner.</p>
        
            <p>As heavy rain lashed the East Coast, the Wairoa River inundated more than 400 properties, leaving 119 homes yellow stickered - meaning they are not safe to live in.</p>
        
            <p>The town would have flooded less if a channel to let the rising river release into the sea was dug sooner, regional council chairperson Hinewai Ormsby told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>The council has now confirmed it is in the process of commissioning an external review that will look into the management of the river.</p>
        
            <p>"We are reviewing the cause of flooding, operating procedures for the river mouth openings, and timelines associated with the event," chief executive Dr Nic Peet said.</p>
        
            <p>The review of operating procedures was expected this week and would be made public, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"The technical review of flooding causes will be done as fast as possible, but is complex."</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa locals have criticised the regional council for not making the decision to dig out the river mouth - known as 'opening the bar' - much sooner.</p>
        
            <p>Steve Kelly's recently-repaired home was ruined in the flood, leaving him and his sick wife living in a caravan.</p>
        
            <p>Locals know the river, and the council must listen to them, he told RNZ's First Up.</p>
        
            <p>"We've lost everything, and [the] regional council's actually to blame for this," Kelly said.</p>
        
            <p>"We actually had a meeting with them, me and my neighbour, about three weeks ago, and told them they need to dredge the river and prep a bar.</p>
        
            <p>"And they didn't do it."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, an independent review into how Hawke's Bay's flood protection measures stood up during Cyclone Gabrielle was due to be released on 24 July, the regional council said.</p>
        
            <p>Wairoa does not have any flood protection, but $70 million has been earmarked to protect it from flooding.</p>
        
            <p>The regional council, along with Wairoa District Council and Tﾄ》au Tﾄ》au o Te Wairoa were still working with the community to land on the best solution, but the immediate focus was recovering from the most recent flood, Peet said.</p>
        
            <p>"When the time is right, we will continue the development of a flood mitigation option with WDC and Tﾄ》au Tﾄ》au o te Wairoa."</p>
