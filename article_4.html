            <p>Orange heavy rain and strong wind warnings are in place for the north-east of the North Island.</p>
        
            <p>A low heading to the region on Tuesday, and moving east on Wednesday, was set to bring heavy rain to Hawke's Bay and Gisborne / Tai Rāwhiti, especially from State Highway 5 to Tolaga Bay, MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>About 150mm to 180mm of rain is expected inland, and 80mm to 120mm of rain about the coast, with peak intensities of 10mm/h to 15mm/h from Tuesday afternoon until before dawn on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>The persistent strong winds will also bring large waves along the coast, peaking overnight Tuesday into Wednesday.The southeast swell could mean sizeable waves around Gisborne harbour.Marine conditions slowly ease from Thursday. pic.twitter.com/YwDFYjCSpu</p>
        
            <p>Severe southerly gales are also expected about northern Hawke's Bay and Gisborne. The gales could reach 120 km/h in exposed places, and the strongest winds are expected in coastal places.</p>
        
            <p>Large easterly swells are forecast to affect coastal parts of Gisborne and Hawke's Bay later on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said erosion and coastal inundation were possible in some places, especially during high tides.</p>
        
            <p>The heavy rain warning was in place until 9pm on Wednesday. The wind warning will be in place from 4pm Tuesday until 10am Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said there was a low chance of the warnings being upgraded to red.</p>
        
            <p>The weather agency advised people in affected regions to clear drains and gutters, avoid low-lying areas, secure items outside on their property, and drive cautiously.</p>
        
            <p>A heavy rain watch is in place north of Tolaga Bay and south of Ruatoria, and about and south of SH5 in Hawke's Bay. A strong wind watch is in place for Bay of Plenty, east of Ōpōtiki.</p>
