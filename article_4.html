            <p>Crown prosecutors in the Angela Blackmoore murder trial have described evidence against the pair of co-accused as "overwhelming".</p>
        
            <p>Closing arguments began at the Christchurch High Court on Monday in the second trial of David Hawken and Rebecca Wright-Meldrum in front of Justice Rachel Cunningham, for the murder of the Christchurch woman on 17 August, 1995.</p>
        
            <p>Jeremy Powell confessed to Blackmoore's murder in 2019 and previously appeared as a Crown witness, when he told the court Hawken offered him and Wright-Meldrum $10,000 for Blackmoore's murder.</p>
        
            <p>Blackmoore was bludgeoned and stabbed 39 times in her Wainoni home while her two-year-old son slept in a nearby room.</p>
        
            <p>Hawken and Wright-Meldrum have pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering Blackmoore.</p>
        
            <p>The first trial was abandoned in May after after new material came to hand that lawyers needed time to review.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown argues that Hawken arranged for Powell and Wright-Meldrum to murder Blackmoore with the promise of $10,000.</p>
        
            <p>The defence meanwhile argues that the pair had no motive for the killing.</p>
        
            <p>The jury previously heard from Powell who said Hawken also threatened to kill his family if he did not murder Blackmoore, and he took the warning seriously.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutor Pip Currie told the jury Powell was a young man who was "well out of his depth".</p>
        
            <p>"Maybe the 49-year-old Jeremy Powell that we see in the witness box would've handled things differently if this had happened.</p>
        
            <p>"But you have to look back and remember this was a young man."</p>
        
            <p>Currie later dismissed arguments made by the defence, around Powell's interest in the Dungeons and Dragons board game.</p>
        
            <p>"Supposedly, because Jeremy Powell played Dungeons and Dragons - the board game with dice and other participants - that translates into him being a sadistic killer.</p>
        
            <p>"I suggest that is totally far-fetched and ludicrous to make a submission like that.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no evidential foundation."</p>
        
            <p>The Crown cited several factors during closing submissions, including evidence by Blackmoore's ex-husband William Blackmoore who claimed Hawken threatened to name him as the instigator of her death.</p>
        
            <p>"The evidence is overwhelming ... absolutely overwhelming and points you (the jury) in only one direction."</p>
        
            <p>The defence began its closing arguments on Monday afternoon.</p>
