            <p>The Health Ministry has again delayed its long-awaited review of the evidence for transgender children and teenagers' use of puberty blockers after a highly critical report from Britain.</p>
        
            <p>Hormone blockers, which stop the physical changes of puberty, are under scrutiny internationally, after a four-year independent inquiry in Britain found "remarkably weak evidence" for their use.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the New Zealand Ministry of Health announced its own evidence brief - which was originally due in November - would be published this week.</p>
        
            <p>However, chief medical officer Dr Joe Bourne said he now expected it to be released in "the very near future", along with a position statement to give clinicians guidance.</p>
        
            <p>"The Ministry of Health is awaiting some final feedback on its position statement from key stakeholders.</p>
        
            <p>"In addition, a considerable amount of new material was published in the UK last week. The ministry is taking time to review this material against our own evidence brief for any new findings."</p>
        
            <p>Dr Bourne thanked the public for their ongoing patience.</p>
        
            <p>"We know there is considerable public interest in the evidence brief and the issue in general."</p>
        
            <p>Britain's National Health Service banned the routine use of puberty blockers for gender affirming care in March, ahead of the release of the final report by leading paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass.</p>
        
            <p>The Professional Association for Transgender Healthcare Aotearoa (PATHA) has been dismissive of the Cass report, which it said failed to uphold the experience of affirmative care.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson, Dr Rona Carroll, said the sector would welcome more long-term research, but there was evidence that gender-affirming medications improved wellbeing.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand Te Whatu Ora has commissioned PATHA to update its guidelines for gender-affirming care for healthcare professionals, which will cover the use of puberty blockers. That work is due to be completed by August.</p>
