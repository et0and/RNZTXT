        <h2>Live: 'Significant' flooding across Dunedin, multiple slips</h2>
        <p>
There is "significant surface flooding" in many suburbs and people are being warned to stay off the roads as more rain pummels the city.
</p>
        
            <p>A red heavy rain warning remains in force for Otago, with torrential downpours drenching parts of the region overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Many Dunedin residents have evacuated their homes due to rising floodwaters.</p>
        
            <p>It comes after storms caused power cuts and blocked roads in Coromandel on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Roads are closed across Dunedin and Clutha due to flooding and slips and a burst water main has cut the water supply to the Otago Pensinsula.</p>
