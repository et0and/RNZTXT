            <p>A section of State Highway 1 has re-opened after a fatal collision killed one person and injured 14 others yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>A small bus loaded with international tourists collided with two vehicles on the highway near Paparamu Road.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were called to the scene just after 2pm and Hato Hone St John yesterday said it took 13 patients to hospitals by road and air.</p>
        
            <p>Two were in a critical condition and another four in a serious condition.</p>
        
            <p>The highway was closed for several hours for more than 10 kilometres, between Tīrau and Piarere roundabout.</p>
        
            <p>A Northern Rescue spokesperson said both Auckland Westpac Rescue Helicopters transported a teenager and a man in his 40's to Auckland City Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Taupō road policing manager Senior Sergeant Fane Troy told RNZ there were 11 tourists and their driver in the mini-van, and three others in the two other vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>He said one person died and the 14 others involved were injured. Initial indications were that some suffered serious injuries.</p>
        
            <p>It was not clear yet where the tourists were from, but Troy said they were from outside New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>He said it was too early to establish the cause of the crash or release details regarding the deceased.</p>
        
            <p>More to come... </p>
