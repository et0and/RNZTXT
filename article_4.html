            <p>Fire and Emergency says two helicopters have been dispatched on Saturday morning to a wildfire in north Canterbury.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze - which had been burning since Thursday night - had torn through more than 100 hectares of pine forest north of Waipara.</p>
        
            <p>It had been contained but was not yet under control, FENZ said.</p>
        
            <p>Crews had been monitoring the site overnight on Friday, and heavy machinery and helicopters had been brought in to fight the fire on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>The fire was visible from the road, but neighbouring properties were not in danger.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said it could take days to extinguish.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this year, a 300ha vegetation fire in the Waikari Valley forced the evacuation of properties in Waipara.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, firefighters responded to a house fire in Wairarapa on Saturday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Seven trucks were called to a residential property in the seaside town of Castlepoint about 4.30am.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said an investigator had been sent to the site, but there were no indications so far the fire was suspicious.</p>
        
            <p>Crews had extinguished the fire and were dampening down the scene.</p>
