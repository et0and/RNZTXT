            <p>A junior doctors' strike will go ahead on Tuesday after one of their unions and Te Whatu Ora failed to reach a last-minute agreement.</p>
        
            <p>That meant about half the country's junior doctors would walk off the job for 24 hours from 7am.</p>
        
            <p>The two sides were holding talks as late as Monday morning to try to avoid the action.</p>
        
            <p>The doctors said they were striking in support of a few hundred of their members set to get a pay cut.</p>
