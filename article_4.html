            <p>A Hamilton school has come out of lockdown after reports of a firearm seen on the same street.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday afternoon, Frankton School on Massey Street said it had gone into lockdown just after 2pm.</p>
        
            <p>It said on its website there was a "police presence outside school".</p>
        
            <p>"Please do not come to the school or phone the school as you will not be attended to. We will update this website when the lockdown is completed."</p>
        
            <p>In a later update it said children are able to be up off the floor and use the toilets while supervised.</p>
        
            <p>"We are still in lockdown and remaining inside school buildings."</p>
        
            <p>At 2.48pm, principal Kirsten Ratana said the lockdown was over and everyone at the school was safe.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone did extremely well and responded to instructions. A notice will be going out to parents/caregivers tonight to provide some more information about our emergency lockdown procedures."</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, police said officers responded to a possible firearm being seen on Massey Street at 1.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>"A man was taken into custody a short time ago.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage no firearm has been located."</p>
