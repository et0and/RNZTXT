            <p>An 18-year-old has been charged and another two teens referred to Youth Aid after a vehicle was allegedly hijacked in Bucklands Beach on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>A series of incidents also led to a dog that had been allegedly removed from a property during a burglary being handed back to its owner.</p>
        
            <p>Counties Manukau East Area crime prevention manager Inspector Rakana Cook said several worrying incidents began at 12.25pm when two people sitting in their car on Murvale Drive were approached by a man.</p>
        
            <p>"It's understood this person has presented a weapon and forced both people out of the car before taking it and fleeing the area towards MacLeans Road.</p>
        
            <p>"This male has also taken a number of personal items, which were in the vehicle at the time."</p>
        
            <p>Around 5pm the same car and two others, also alleged to have been stolen, arrived at a a petrol station in Pakuranga.</p>
        
            <p>Inspector Cook said the vehicles were already being monitored by the police's Eagle helicopter because one had been reported doing burnouts on Pakuranga Road.</p>
        
            <p>"With the assistance of our police helicopter, ground units were guided in, who attempted to block in the vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>"However, upon those in the vehicle sighting police, two fled the area and a third was abandoned."</p>
        
            <p>One was driven dangerously through Pakuranga, she said, and then the occupants met up again with the other vehicle in Portadown Avenue.</p>
        
            <p>At that stage all three were arrested without incident.</p>
        
            <p>The 18-year-old is due to appear in the Manukau District Court today on charges relating to aggravated burglary and the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle. Two youths, aged 17, have been referred to Youth Aid.</p>
        
            <p>"We thank the members of the public who reported these matters to us in a swift manner, which allowed our staff to respond accordingly."</p>
        
            <p>Cook said incidents such as that one caused frustration and concern for the community and police were trying hard to bring those responsible for the behaviour to account.</p>
        
            <p>Officers found a dog in one of the vehicles and it was handed over to Animal Management.</p>
        
            <p>A Counties Manukau West sergeant noted a dog had been reported stolen after a previous burglary which led to the dog being reunited with its owner.</p>
        
            <p>"This was fantastic work from police to conclude another incident and bring a resolution to another victim," Inspector Cook said.</p>
