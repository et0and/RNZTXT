            <p>A major New Zealand security firm says multi-factor authentication will not necessarily save you - or your company - from cyber attacks, with the method at the heart of some of the most egregious security breaches on both sides of the Tasman.</p>
        
            <p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) - or two-step authentication - is a method that bolsters security by asking users to log in using two different types of security before allowing access.</p>
        
            <p>For example, logging into a business email could require a regular password plus a second code sent by text to a phone.</p>
        
            <p>In its latest threat report, CyberCX said the global threat landscape had continued to deteriorate, with bad actors evolving their tactics and upping the tempo of attacks.</p>
        
            <p>It coincided with the release of the government's own report into cyber security, which found New Zealand was facing "increasingly complex cyber security threats from both criminals and other countries".</p>
        
            <p>CyberCX said MFA breaches were responsible for three-quarters of the phishing attacks it responded to last year - where hackers attempted to gain access to information, typically financial, via email.</p>
        
            <p>Executive director of digital forensics and incident response Hamish Krebs said any MFA was better than none, but not all MFA was created equal.</p>
        
            <p>He said text message authentication was by far the worst of the MFA options, and the best a hardware security key or token.</p>
        
            <p>Krebs said push notifications on a phone were the most common tactic, with a threat actor pushing an authentication through and a user eventually saying 'yes'.</p>
        
            <p>"That happens all the time. You don't really want to have a situation where your phone is bothering you to allow a multi-factor authentication."</p>
        
            <p>He said his company had seen fake push notifications lead to "very large data breaches".</p>
        
            <p>"Across both sides of the Tasman some of the very biggest ones - the highest profile ones - have happened via an administrator clicking a spurious multi-factor authentication prompt because it's bothered them on their phone.</p>
        
            <p>"Imagine that phone beeps you five, six, seven, eight, nine times and you're in a meeting - eventually you just say, 'accept'. It goes away, but that lets the bad guys in."</p>
        
            <p>CyberCX said financial gain was still the biggest motivation, behind 65 percent of the incidents it responded to last year.</p>
        
            <p>The healthcare sector remained under fire from cyber attacks, making up 17 percent of incidents it responded to - the biggest category.</p>
        
            <p>The financial sector followed on 11 percent.</p>
