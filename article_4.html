            <p>He was expected to appear in the Gisborne District Court on 27 March.</p>
        
            <p>Police have been standing guard outside the hospital, but following the man's arrest, de Lange said police would no longer have an ongoing presence there.</p>

            <p>Stevens-Mark had been celebrating his birthday, while Taare-Gray was an uninvited guest.</p>
        
            <p>The tangi for Taare-Gray will be held at Hauiti Marae in Tolaga Bay, with the burial expected to be on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Police were not able to elaborate on the cause of death, beyond the fact that both men died from injuries sustained during the brawl, de Lange said.</p>
        
            <p>A karakia has been performed where the incident occurred and the scene was expected to be released back to whƒÅnau on Tuesday evening.</p>
        
            <p>Officers would continue to carry out reassurance patrols in Gisborne but there had been no reported incidents related to the brawl over the weekend, de Lange said.</p>
        
            <p>Police still wanted to hear from anyone who was at the party on Saturday evening or anyone who had photos or videos of the celebration or altercation, he said.</p>
