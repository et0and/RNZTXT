        <h2>'He is an angry man': Pauline Hanna recorded saying about husband before death</h2>
        <p>
The High Court murder trial heard a recording of Pauline Hanna saying her husband was angry and wanted to have sex with everyone.

            <p>Warning: This article contains discussion of potential suicide. </p>
        
            <p>An Auckland woman allegedly murdered by her retired eye surgeon husband had described him as a sex fiend and an angry man, in a recording played for the court.</p>
        
            <p>Philip Polkinghorne, 71, is accused of killing his wife, Pauline Hanna, in their multi-million dollar Remuera home three years ago.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown claims Polkinghorne killed her and staged the scene as suicide, something the defence denies.</p>
        
            <p>Her brother, Bruce Hanna, took the witness stand in the High Court in Auckland on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>He revealed details about his sister and Polkinghorne's relationship.</p>
        
            <p>Bruce Hanna believed Polkinghorne pushed his sister into participating in sex acts which she would not ordinarily engage in, like group sex.</p>
        
            <p>Bruce Hanna said Pauline seemed less happy when she was with Polkinghorne, and that this would spill over into solo trips she took to visit the family.</p>
        
            <p>He said Hanna had told him about the other women Polkinghorne was seeing, including someone in Sydney, Australia, and visits he would make to prostitutes in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>"She told me she wasn't very happy with the relationship," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The jury was played a recording taken by Bruce Hanna's daughter, of a tense family exchange in which Polkinghorne and his behaviour was discussed.</p>
        
            <p>In the clip, Pauline Hanna expressed her discomfort at Polkinghorne's extramarital affairs.</p>
        
            <p>"He goes off and screws women when he's away, and I could take... well, I do take a very foul view of that ... and he hurts me, but I know he loves me," she said.</p>
        
            <p>She called him a sex fiend and claimed he just wanted to have sex with everyone.</p>
        
            <p>"He's really hurt me, to the extent that sometimes I've thought 'well, why am I living with him' but I love him, and he loves me, and actually it's just his malfunction," she said in the recording.</p>
        
            <p>"He is an angry man.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not going to let him destroy me," she told family.</p>
        
            <p>Pauline Hanna claimed Polkinghorne wanted a smart woman as a trophy wife, but asserted she would not be made to feel like a doormat.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not going to put up with it forever," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm not a doormat, but I do love him."</p>
        
            <p>Despite the tense conversation, Pauline Hanna was still sympathetic toward her husband.</p>
        
            <p>"Please don't think Philip's a beast," she said. "He's not."</p>
        
            <p>Bruce Hanna was cross examined by Polkinghorne's defence lawyer, Ron Mansfield KC.</p>
        
            <p>He asked if Bruce Hanna was aware of his sister's prescriptions for anti-depressants, as well as an attempt she made, some 30 years ago, to take her life shortly after their father died.</p>
        
            <p>Bruce Hanna said he was unaware of the prescriptions or suicide attempt.</p>
        
            <p>He said he and his sister were close.</p>
        
            <p>"Yeah, we've lived different lives, but we've always kept in contact, and when we can we've always caught up and seen each other."</p>
        
            <p>Earlier in the trial on Thursday, a jury watched footage of Polkinghorne questioning if he put too much expectation on his wife before her death.</p>
        
            <p>He wondered if he encouraged her to do to much, including pushing her to write something on home dialysis, something she had instituted as a policy at Middlemore Hospital. He also wondered whether he could have listened more to her concerns.</p>
        
            <p>The trial continues.</p>
