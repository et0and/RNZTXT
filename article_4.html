            <p>Paramedics said it was obvious Karori man Rau Tongia had been dead some time when they arrived.</p>
        
            <p>Tongia was killed on Percy Dyett Drive in the early hours of 20 December, 2020. A murder trial is under way in the Wellington High Court over his death, with five women accused of being involved. The Crown alleges Tongia was shot while he slept.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown has begun calling witnesses.</p>
        
            <p>Paramedics from Wellington Free Ambulance said they received a callout around 8am on the morning in question.</p>
        
            <p>One of the first paramedics to respond said he observed that the patient's jaw was stiff, indicating he had been dead for some time.</p>
        
            <p>Another said his pupils were not reacting to light.</p>
        
            <p>The paramedics also recalled seeing a significant amount of blood on Tongia's mattress, the left side of his torso and a large wound on his back.</p>
        
            <p>Four of the five women accused - Shayde Weston, Breeze Hunt-Weston, Louise Kelly Hume and Pania Waaka - on Monday pleaded not guilty to murder. The fifth defendant was not present due to health reasons.</p>
        
            <p>A man last year was convicted in relation to the Tongia's death, found guilty possession of a firearm and sentenced to four-and-a-half months' community detention and 12 months' intense supervision.</p>
