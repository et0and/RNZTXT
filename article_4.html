            <p>Wellington Tamil Society is organizing a special event in the capital this month to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the community's activities in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>Held at the Takina Convention Centre, the event will showcase Tamil artefacts, including old utensils, clothing, decorative items and ancient Tamil literature.</p>
        
            <p>"We're trying to bring Tamil culture and identity into the mainstream," says Pathmanathan Brabhaharan, president of Wellington Tamil Society.</p>

            <p>Brabhaharan says the Tamil community has contributed to New Zealand for more than half a century, and it's time to share their culture with a wider Kiwi population.</p>
        
            <p>"There was an uptick in the number of Tamil people arriving in New Zealand in the 1980s due to the Tamil conflict in Sri Lanka," he says.</p>
        
            <p>The Sri Lankan civil war, which claimed an estimated 100,000 lives, ended in 2009 when government forces crushed a 40-year insurgency by members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.</p>
        
            <p>"Many Tamil people were affected and fled Sri Lanka to various parts of the world, including New Zealand," Brabhaharan says.</p>
        
            <p>Today, New Zealand's Tamil community has roots in multiple countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
        
            <p>Brabhaharan says Wellington Tamil Society serves Tamil residents regardless of an individual's origins, with a shared language and culture uniting them in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"The society was started in 1983 and was originally aimed at supporting new migrants coming into New Zealand, but it has evolved into a socio-cultural organisation over the years," he says.</p>
        
            <p>Originally from Sri Lanka, Brabhaharan moved to New Zealand 35 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>He points to the formation of the Tamil School in Lower Hutt in 1989 as one of the society's key achievements.</p>
        
            <p>"The school plays a major role in ensuring our second-generation community grows up with a strong awareness of Tamil language, culture and heritage, so they can carry our traditions into the next generation," Brabhaharan says.</p>

            <p>Sivagnanaratanam SriRamaratnam, former Wellington Tamil Society secretary and president, agrees.</p>
        
            <p>SriRamaratnam, known by many as Ram, led the society between 1990 and 2009.</p>
        
            <p>He says about 100 children are currently enrolled in Tamil School to learn Tamil language and culture.</p>
        
            <p>SriRamaratnam moved to New Zealand in 1986 after completing his studies in the United States and became heavily involved in organising sports activities for the Wellington Tamil community.</p>
        
            <p>"I played cricket for my school and my university and then I began doing it here for the community," he says.</p>
        
            <p>SriRamaratnam also believes the Sri Lankan civil war pushed many Tamils out of the country, and, lured by New Zealand's need for educated professionals such as IT engineers and doctors, many chose the South Pacific nation as their new home.</p>
        
            <p>"If you look at the Wellington community, more than 50 percent have roots in Sri Lanka," he says.</p>
        
            <p>SriRamaratnam was awarded the King's Service Medal in 2023 for his services to the Tamil community.</p>
        
            <p>Brabhaharan emphasizes the importance of promoting Tamil culture within the community.</p>
        
            <p>"As migrants, one of the things we notice is that our children often lead two lives," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"At home, they live one life, and outside, they live another," he says.</p>
        
            <p>"Because many people outside don't know much about Tamils, it's important for us to promote our culture so that children grow up proud and confident of their roots."</p>
        
            <p>Brabhaharan says the event is supported by other Tamil associations across the country.</p>
        
            <p>"We want to showcase our Tamil identity and culture to the wider society, which is why we are organizing this event," he says.</p>
