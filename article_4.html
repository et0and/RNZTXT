        <h2>Whangārei tourism boost with first cruise ship visits in decades this summer</h2>
        <p>
Three ships are due at Northport, at Marsden Point this summer, each carrying around 700 passengers, as a welcome boost to Whangārei's tourism.

            <p>The Northland city of Whangārei is gearing up to welcome its first cruise ship visits in decades this summer.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Vince Cocurullo said three ships were due at Northport, at Marsden Point, this season, with another seven booked the following summer.</p>
        
            <p>The first, MS Regatta, with just under 700 passengers, was due to visit on 4 February.</p>
        
            <p>"It's the first time in a very, very long time we've had cruise ships in Whangārei. Now they're back, which is absolutely wonderful, and what it means for the economy in Whangārei and Northland as a whole is amazing."</p>
        
            <p>Although the visits were starting small - none of the ships carried more than 770 passengers - they followed years of effort by tourism leaders to persuade cruise ship companies to add the district to their itineraries.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Vince Cocurullo said one key factor had lured them back after a decades-long absence.</p>
        
            <p>"The biggest thing that has changed has definitely been the Hundertwasser Art Centre. Having the Hundertwasser created and developed as a tourist attraction has set the cruise ships' connection back to Whangarei," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We've got loads of other things in Whangārei, as anyone who lives here knows, however the Hundertwasser is an internationally renowned art gallery, and realistically that was the key thing."</p>
        
            <p>The Hundertwasser Art Centre was designed by the Austrian artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser, who spent much of the latter years of his life near Kawakawa.</p>
        
            <p>The centre was hugely controversial prior to its construction and finally opened in 2022.</p>

            <p>Cocurullo said welcoming cruise ships to the district was a chance for Whangārei to share its history and culture with visitors through experiences, great products and services, and local food and beverages.</p>
        
            <p>He said regional development agency Northland Inc, business group NorthChamber, the council and Northport were working with tourism operators to ensure a positive experience for visitors that also respected Whangārei's environment and culture.</p>
        
            <p>"We're also very mindful of any potential impacts on residents, but with a very manageable number of ships arriving over the next few years, we expect minimal disruption for the community."</p>
        
            <p>Cruise ship passengers would be encouraged to pre-book excursions before arriving at Northport.</p>
        
            <p>The rest of the passengers would travel by bus to Whangārei's Town Basin.</p>
        
            <p>Markets, ambassadors and an i-Site team would be based at the Town Basin to entertain and support them.</p>
        
            <p>Cocurullo said an increase in buses on the day could lead to minor delays.</p>
        
            <p>Northport chief executive Jon Moore said being able to start small, and build up to manageable levels in years to come, was a great option for Whangārei.</p>
        
            <p>Further north, the Bay of Islands' cruise ship industry is on a different scale.</p>
        
            <p>This season the Bay is expecting a record 92 ships carrying just under 160,000 passengers - surpassing even the pre-Covid peak of 83 ships in 2019-20.</p>
        
            <p>Last season 43 ships called into the Bay of Islands, with some visits cancelled due to bad weather or when ships were refused entry due to biofouling of their hulls.</p>
