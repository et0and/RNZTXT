            <p>The final details were today still being hammered out for a major change in West Coast health services which is just a fortnight away.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 October, the Coast's weekend urgent GP clinics are set to disappear.</p>
        
            <p>Primary health organisation West Coast Health (WCH) said the clinics are operating at a loss and struggle for staff. It plans to replace them with telehealth provider, Ka Ora, and some clinician backup.</p>
        
            <p>Chief executive Caro Findlay said today the last details were still being worked through.</p>
        
            <p>WCH's "decision document" would be sent to Health NZ West Coast staff, the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists (ASMS) and the New Zealand Nurses Organisation (NZNO) tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>"On Friday we will make a media statement announcing the outcome of the proposal," Findlay said.</p>
        
            <p>Findlay told The News last week that flyers detailing the changes would be delivered to every West Coast household from Monday this week.</p>
        
            <p>She said today the flyers were still being printed. They would be delivered by teams of volunteers to ensure every home received them before 1 October, she said.</p>
        
            <p>WCH has not consulted the community about the service cut.</p>
        
            <p>Patient Voice Aotearoa chairperson Dr Malcolm Mulholland said that was not good enough.</p>
        
            <p>"West Coast Health needs to slow down, take a breather and engage with the public before ending weekend GP clinics from next month," Mulholland told The News last week.</p>
        
            <p>"Why the rush, especially when the consequences are so severe?"</p>
        
            <p>The proposal to cut weekend GP clinics emerged last month when a consultation document for health staff was leaked to the media.</p>
        
            <p>Both the ASMS and the NZNO have submitted against the cut, saying it puts patients at risk.</p>
        
            <p>Both also said WCH's consultation document lacked detail.</p>
        
            <p>"The removal of in-person after-hours care presents serious risks for the West Coast community that need to be carefully assessed and mitigated," the doctors' submission said.</p>
        
            <p>The NZNO's submission said Buller Hospital had already been closed seven times this year by understaffing.</p>
        
            <p>"Further closures in the absence of primary care services providing urgent after-hours care would be untenable and create extreme risk," the NZNO said.</p>
        
            <p>Findlay has said the only way to avoid the cuts is more government funding.</p>
        
            <p>The News is seeking comment from Health Minister Dr Shane Reti.</p>
        
            <p>A health protest march is planned in Westport on 28 September.</p>
