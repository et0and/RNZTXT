            <p>A man is suspected of allegedly attacking and taking a black swan in the Auckland park at Western Springs.</p>
        
            <p>In a post on Facebook, a photographer says the man entered the park from Great North Road then bent over as to feed a black swan before grabbing it by the head, beating it several times and and shoving it into what appeared to be a black sack-like bag.</p>
        
            <p>The photographer said he then walked back to the Great North Road entrance with the bag in his hand.</p>
        
            <p>The photographer has reported the incident to the Ministry of Primary Industries, the Auckland Council, SPCA as well as Fish and Game.</p>
        
            <p>Black swans are partially protected species and can only be hunted in season according to regional limits.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Council Director for Community Rachel Kelleher told Stuff in a statement that "in no instances should members of the public be harming or killing black swan on park and reserve land without the necessary approvals."</p>
        
            <p>MPI said it is making enquiries into the incident.</p>
