            <p>An inquest into the death of a 3-year-old found in Gore's sewage ponds will enter its second phase in the Invercargill District Court this morning.</p>
        
            <p>Lachlan Jones was found unresponsive in Gore District Council oxidation pond on 29 January 2019 ,just over a kilometre from his mother's house, where he lived.</p>
        
            <p>Two police investigations found the boy accidentally drowned.</p>
        
            <p>But his father Paul Jones did not accept that and told the coroner during the first phase inquest in May that officers botched the case.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know what's happened on this day. I don't know how my son got out there. I'm here to find the answers," Jones said, during a tense exchange with the lawyer for police Robin Bates.</p>
        
            <p>"It just seems like a bloody botched up police job and you're trying to fix it."</p>
        
            <p>During the three-week long first phase inquest, Jones' lawyer Max Simpkins raised the prospect Lachlan's mother Michelle Officer and her two older sons killed the boy, before storing his body in a freezer and then dumping it in the sewage pond.</p>
        
            <p>The two-week second phase inquest would hear from several expert witnesses, including a retired American crime scene investigator, with one of the Lachlan's half brothers also again taking the stand.</p>
