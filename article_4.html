        <h2>Quarry risk to TranzAlpine train, but no quick fix</h2>
        <p>
Delays in the decommissioning of dangerous rock quarry near Greymouth have raised the ire of a West Coast regional councillor.

            <p>Delays in the decommissioning of dangerous rock quarry near Greymouth have raised the ire of a West Coast regional councillor.</p>
        
            <p>A fresh report on the mothballed Kiwi Point Quarry this week to council's Infrastructure Governance Group did not go down well with councillor Peter Ewen.</p>

            <p>Ewen, a recognised West Coast mine historian, said the risk to the public from the site had already been on the radar for at least six years and the fresh report - following a geotechnical report in mid-2022 - made no reference to the abandoned underground mine shafts dating back to the 1920s beneath the site.</p>
        
            <p>The site remains on notice from WorkSafe.</p>
        
            <p>Ewen said the risk of the site's collapse onto the TranzAlpine tourist train route and State Highway 7 had been well signalled - as seen in June 2022 when the train ran into a slip below the quarry access road.</p>
        
            <p>"The risk is there. Furthermore, in 2018 it was highlighted it would affect the state highway and the TranzAlpine. Well, in 2022 the train hit a slip there - under the bridge."</p>
        
            <p>The TranzAlpine hit a slip beneath the Kiwi Point rail overbridge. That incident was relatively minor but, "heaven forbid, we have a large slip and another train or vehicle gets caught", Ewen said.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm pretty disappointed with [the report] actually because historically there has been front page stories on this site.</p>
        
            <p>"There's quite a void there and to not have that included in a report is a deficiency I'm not prepared to accept."</p>
        
            <p>Council ceased operating the quarry about 2020 after 45 years of extraction.</p>
        
            <p>Since then part of the access road has been removed to deal with the slip risk onto the road and railway below.</p>
        
            <p>"I've raised this before â€¦ the risk is sub-surface.</p>
        
            <p>"The deficiency of not having that in those official reports is not right. I object to receiving these like this," Ewen said.</p>
        
            <p>He said "a big cavernous shaft" in the area escalated the risk yet council now had two reports which failed to appraise that.</p>
        
            <p>Ewen has repeatedly raised the risk to council staff in public meetings in the past two years.</p>
        
            <p>He said his concerns could be verified by historic mine maps and the issue was well known locally.</p>
        
            <p>A staff report said the latest consultant study recommended "an extensive amount of work which will be costly".</p>
        
            <p>Acting catchments manager Shanti Morgan said another "risk assessment" on the quarry's current status, as well as on the necessary work to make it safe, were recommended.</p>
        
            <p>That would allow for cost estimates to formally decommission the site, Morgan said.</p>

            <p>Council chief executive Darryl Lew said Ewen should be tapped by staff to ensure the consultant was fully informed, pending an expanded report.</p>
        
            <p>Committee chair Frank Dooley said while the latest report was based on scope, "if that scope is deficient that is another issue".</p>
        
            <p>"What councillor Ewen is saying, that is an issue."</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Peter Haddock agreed and said the quarry being above an historic mine was known, as was the risk from a local faultline nearby.</p>
        
            <p>He also said the latest report effectively repeated the previous 2022 report.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Brett Cummings said the latest report did identify a rock knob above the quarry as something council had to deal with given it was a fall risk.</p>
        
            <p>"Council didn't put it there - that seems unfair. That's going to be the dearest part, removing that natural feature."</p>
