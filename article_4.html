            <p>Nine people have been injured in a multi-vehicle crash on the shores of Lake Pukaki.</p>
        
            <p>Locals said weather conditions were poor when the accident happened on State Highway 8 in the South Island this morning.</p>
        
            <p>A Red Cat Biplane Flight spokesman said it was minus two degrees in the area this morning, with fog and ice on the road.</p>
        
            <p>The crash - which was reported just before 10.30am on Sunday - was in the same area where 15 people were injured on Thursday, when two buses crashed in separate incidents.</p>
        
            <p>The road is closed between State Highway 80 and Pukaki Canal Road.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John said it sent two ambulances, two first response units, one rapid response unit, two managers, one PRIME vehicle and three helicopters to the scene, assessing nine patients.</p>
        
            <p>One patient was airlifted to Christchurch Hospital in a serious condition, two others to Dunedin Hospital. Six with minor conditions were treated at the scene.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Transport Agency says drivers should expect delays on both roads, which are also known as Mount Cook Road and the Tekap≈ç-Twizel Highway. Black ice warnings are currently in place for the area.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, in the North Island there is a road closure in the Napier suburb of Taradale following a crash involving a vehicle and a cyclist just before 11am on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>Neeve Road is closed near the intersection of Church Road and detours are in place.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the cyclist had been taken to hospital with serious injuries.</p>
        
            <p>Police said motorists should avoid the area and expect delays, with the road expected to be closed for some time.</p>
