            <p>Faulty landing gear has forced a Hawaiian Airlines flight to turn back to Auckland Airport.</p>
        
            <p>Flight HA446, which was en route to Honolulu, returned to Auckland Airport soon after its departure close to midnight on Saturday, after landing gear did not retract, a Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were placed on standby for the landing, and fire and rescue appliances from the airport and eight other stations in the area were called out, on Sunday morning, just after midnight.</p>
        
            <p>The flight landed safely, and all passengers on board disembarked safely, an Auckland Airport spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>The 253 passengers who were on board the flight were being provided with hotel accommodation while the aircraft was inspected and the problem fixed, the airline spokesperson said.</p>
