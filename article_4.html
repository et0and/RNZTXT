            <p>Police have launched a homicide enquiry after finding a body in a burning car on a beach near Dargaville.</p>
        
            <p>Emergency services were alerted to a car on fire on Ripiro Beach about 10.30am yesterday Monday.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Inspector Al Symonds, of Northland CIB, said a body was discovered inside the vehicle, which was placed under guard overnight.</p>

            <p>A scene examination was now underway at the beach and a nearby property in Te Kopuru, a settlement 12km south of Dargaville.</p>
        
            <p>"The circumstances surrounding the fire and how the car came to be on the beach are as yet unexplained.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that events like this are incredibly concerning for our community."</p>
        
            <p>Symonds said no arrests had been made but police were speaking with a person of interest.</p>
        
            <p>"At this stage we are not seeking anyone else in relation to this incident."</p>
        
            <p>Symonds said there was no connection with the death of Joanna Mai Sione-Lauaki whose body was discovered further north on the same beach in August.</p>
        
            <p>The death of 38-year-old Sione-Lauaki was initially treated as unexplained, but as of last Friday that was now also the subject of a homicide enquiry.</p>
        
            <p>A post-mortem examination and formal identification of the new victim would be carried out over the coming days, Symonds said.</p>
        
            <p>He urged anyone who had been in the area, or had information that could help the enquiry, to get in touch by calling 105, quoting reference number 240908/8425.</p>
        
            <p>Information could also be provided anonymously to Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
