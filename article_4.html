        <h2>Drop in NCEA level 1 success partly due to new requirements</h2>
        <p>
The Qualifications Authority points to new literacy and numeracy requirements as the reason for half of last year's NCEA fails.
</p>
        
            <p>
The new requirements could be met by passing online tests in reading, writing and numeracy or by completing specific standards.

            <p>Half the teens who failed NCEA level 1 did so only because of new literacy and numeracy requirements.</p>
        
            <p>The remainder did not achieve enough credits for the qualification.</p>
        
            <p>Figures provided to RNZ by Education Minister, Erica Stanford showed 13,496 Year 11s who attempted a full NCEA 1 programme last year fell short while 31,524 were successful.</p>
        
            <p>Among those who did not succeed, 54 percent, 7240, had the 60 credits they needed for a level one qualification but failed to achieve the literacy and numeracy requirement.</p>
        
            <p>A further 4892 or 35 percent passed the reading, writing and maths benchmarks, but did not complete enough credits.</p>
        
            <p>The remainder, about 1300 students, failed to get enough credits and also failed to reach the literacy and numeracy requirements.</p>
        
            <p>"The tightened co-requisite literacy and numeracy requirement was the main factor in students not achieving the new NCEA Level 1," the information said.</p>
        
            <p>The new requirements could be met by passing online tests in reading, writing and numeracy or by completing specific standards.</p>
        
            <p>The information said changes to the cohort of students attempting level 1 also affected the achievement rate, but to a much lesser degree.</p>
        
            <p>Last year 64 percent of Year 11 students participated in a full level 1 programme, down from 75 percent in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Schools from well-off communities were least likely to provide level 1, meaning last year's cohort had proportionately more students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
        
            <p>The information provided to RNZ said if the composition of the cohort had not changed, the level 1 achievement rate for those who attempted it would likely have been two percentage points higher at 72 percent.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023 the achievement rate was 82 percent with 75 percent of Year 11s participating.</p>
        
            <p>Pass rates for levels 2 and 3 and for University Entrance were about the same as in 2023, NZQA said.</p>
        
            <p>"Provisional 2024 NCEA Level 2 attainment by students in Year 12 is 72.7 percent compared to 73.2 percent in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>"Year 13 provisional attainment of NCEA Level 3 is 68.2 percent compared to 67.7 percent in 2023, and Year 13 University Entrance (UE) attainment is 48.2 percent compared to 49.7 percent in 2023."</p>
        
            <p>NZQA final results tended to be slightly higher than provisional results</p>
        
            <p>It said the final level 1 result was likely to be one to 1.5 percentage points higher than the provisional result.</p>
        
            <p>Education Minister Erica Stanford said the results showed the reality of literacy and numeracy achievement, something the old NCEA system failed to do.</p>
        
            <p>"While these Level 1 students will have another two years to pass this requirement, it's important to note the level it is set at is foundational and in line with a level of the curriculum that equates to the end of Year 8 and beginning of Year 9," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said the government was moving to improve literacy and numeracy through curriculum changes and direct support to students who needed it most.</p>
        
            <p>Education Minister Erica Stanford said a drop in NCEA level 1 achievement is serious but not unexpected.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said the level 1 achievement drop was partly due to new literacy and numeracy requirements and some teenagers would need more help to pass.</p>
        
            <p>"We could see last year there were a number of teenagers not getting across the line with their literacy and numeracy required assessments and that has borne out in the results," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"There were many kids, or students, who got their required NCEA credits, but then just did not get the foundational literacy and numeracy assessment."</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said those students would have another chance to pass the tests this year, or they could meet the literacy and numeracy requirements by completing specific achievement standards.</p>
        
            <p>She said they should not give up.</p>
        
            <p>"Please keep going, we will give you all of the help that you need, schools will give you the help that you need," Stanford said.</p>
        
            <p>She said the government wanted to avoid similar falls in level two and three pass rates in future.</p>
        
            <p>"I expect next year that level 2 will dip slightly," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Stanford said the government had changed the literacy and numeracy tests to ensure they were fair for students such as by reducing the amount of reading required for the numeracy test.</p>
        
            <p>It had also extended the use of the achievement standard alternatives to the tests until the end of 2027 and was providing extra teaching at some schools.</p>
        
            <p>"We will not leave these young people behind. We've already at the end of last year identified the schools who need the most help and we've already gone to them and said here's a package of resources and tutoring and help for your teachers and we'll continue with these new results to identify more schools," she said.</p>
