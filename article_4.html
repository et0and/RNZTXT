            <p>Kmart is recalling an Anko-branded glass pickle jar that it says can break or explode.</p>
        
            <p>The recall applies to products sold between February 2023 and the start of this month.</p>
        
            <p>Kmart said the glass flip pickle jar could break when used to store certain fruit or vegetables in liquid.</p>
        
            <p>"Fermented food stored in affected products can build up gas and cause the jar to explode or make the lid difficult to remove."</p>
        
            <p>Customers were told to stop using the product immediately and return it for a refund.</p>
        
            <p>Kmart said there was a risk of serious injuries from lacerations if the jar exploded, or if the lid broke when it was being removed.</p>
        
            <p>It said injuries had occurred.</p>
