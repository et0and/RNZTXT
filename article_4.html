            <p>A magnitude 4.8 earthquake struck late on Sunday night in southeastern Hawke's Bay, about 5km from Pōrangahau.</p>
        
            <p>It had a shallow depth of 16km and is considered a strong quake by GNS Science.</p>
        
            <p>The GeoNet website showed more than 2000 people across the central and lower North Island reported feeling the shake about 11.20pm.</p>
        
            <p>There were eight aftershocks between 12.05am and 4.05, the strongest being a magnitude 3.3 quake just before 3am.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck central New Zealand. A person in the Wellington suburb of Ōwhiro Bay said it was "a mean jolt, like a truck hitting the house".</p>
        
            <p>Further from the epicentre, in Whanganui, another listener experienced "fine trembling as lead in, then rocking with window sash weights noisy in old two-storey wooden home".</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Region Emergency Management Office regional manager Jeremy Holmes called it a "significant shake for the capital" but with no significant impacts.</p>
        
            <p>A large Wellington apartment building was evacuated on Sunday evening and the area cordoned off due to concerns about structural damage following an earthquake.</p>
        
            <p>Just after midnight, the spokesperson said the building had been assessed by Fire and Emergency New Zealand as safe to re-enter. The 16-storey building has 123 apartments, as well as retail and commercial offices on the lower four floors.</p>
