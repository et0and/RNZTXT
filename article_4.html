            <p>A family business that started out as a cattle farm has turned itself into a picturesque sunflower patch - and made one of Auckland's most popular tourist destinations this summer.</p>
        
            <p>Co-owner Chris Flaunty believed he may have created "the happiest place in New Zealand". His 350-acre Cedel Downs Sunflower Patch, located in West Auckland's Massey, is a sight to behold from the moment you enter.</p>
        
            <p>"Everyone is just so happy when they leave here," Flaunty said. "It's pretty hard not to be."</p>
        
            <p>"My favourite thing is seeing everybody leave with grins ear-to-ear. They're smiling with a couple flowers they've picked to take home."</p>
        
            <p>For Flaunty, the sunflower patch was a family affair. The business was established in 1972, initially breeding Hereford and Belgium Cattle. Then it turned into a commercial beef fattening farm.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, the family had the idea to expand it a sunflower patch after being inspired by similar patches Flaunty saw overseas.</p>
        
            <p>Now, visitors from around the motu can enjoy the picturesque sunflower patch during their summer outings.</p>

            <p>Flaunty said his daughter, Hannah, ran their social media page down in Wellington while other family members in Auckland helped out on the farm.</p>
        
            <p>"Dad who turns 80 this year, he's our parking warden and my sister looks after the entry tent," Flaunty said.</p>
        
            <p>He also credited his mum, who cooked hot meals after the whƒÅnau had spent a long day out in the patch.</p>
        
            <p>Flaunty joked that starting the sunflower patch was "my idea unfortunately".</p>
        
            <p>But fortunately for the family, the expansion of the farm into a sunflower patch has worked out - gaining traction from the general public who want to experience the fresh country air and the flourishing flowers.</p>
        
            <p>Asked how he chose sunflowers for his patch, Flaunty said the flower was "much prettier looking and easier to control the size of it with its spacing".</p>
        
            <p>The sunflowers were planted last year in November over four weekends, with family spending time together to grow and nurture the flowers.</p>
        
            <p>Flaunty said it has been great family bonding.</p>
        
            <p>"It lifted everybody, and it's been fun working with the family on a project like this."</p>
        
            <p>The sunflowers are around for a limited time with the sunflower patch closing up on Tuesday - once the flowers have perished, Flaunty said they would be putting electric fences in "and 250 cattle's head will come and graze off different sections".</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, tickets to Cedel Downs Sunflower Patch can be purchased on Eventfinda for the last little dose of summer happiness.</p>
