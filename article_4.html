            <p>Properties in Havelock North which flooded during Cyclone Gabrielle will again be deemed safe to live in, thanks to a $10 million flood protection plan.</p>
        
            <p>More than 30 homes were damaged in February, when flooding inundated homes during Cyclone Gabrielle. They were then categorised 2C, meaning they were unsafe as-is to live in.</p>
        
            <p>The funding comes as part of Hastings District Council's new strategy for the area's five dams and streams.</p>
        
            <p>The council says the plan will reduce future risk in the areas which flooded during the cyclone, which should allow that area to be recategorised to category 1 by the Hawke's Bay Regional Council.</p>
        
            <p>While the regional council was managing flood mitigation solutions for other affected areas across Hastings, in a deviation from the norm, Hastings District Council was responsible for Havelock North.</p>
        
            <p>For projects related to the Mangarau Dam and stream, the council said it needed government funding, and their new strategy would help inform the business case for that.</p>
        
            <p>Hastings mayor Sandra Hazlehurst said she knew it had been a long 10 months for the owners of flooded homes.</p>
        
            <p>"Our three waters and recovery teams have been keeping those most affected in Havelock North updated, however I know that our broader community is also very interested in what needs to happen across the dams and streams."</p>
        
            <p>Reports on the performance of the dams have been completed and are publicly available.</p>
        
            <p>Another report, commissioned by the regional council on the Mangarau Stream, is still in draft and expected to be completed by the end of the month.</p>
        
            <p>The recent dam report says the dams performed as designed, "throttling" the amount of water being released to reduce the impact on the village.</p>
        
            <p>The amount of rain that fell in the area was 80 percent more than the previous record.</p>
        
            <p>Modelling estimates that without the dam, water flow in the Mangarau Stream would have been another 22 cubic metres (or 22,000 litres) a second - that's 60 percent more than the actual flow recorded, which was 35 cubic metres a second.</p>
        
            <p>Hazlehurst said while previous councils could not have envisaged a storm this size, "now that we have had an event of this significance, with serious outcomes, we need to prioritise work that will further reduce risk".</p>
