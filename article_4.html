            <p>A sinkhole has opened up on Manners Street in Wellington CBD.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said it was working to temporarily clamp the damaged pipe. The surrounding footpath had been closed for safety.</p>
        
            <p>The water services provider was speaking with the power provider before undertaking a more permanent repair, because the sinkhole was near power utilities.</p>
        
            <p>It later said that repairs would be undertaken on Tuesday evening, pending traffic and isolation of the power utilities.</p>
        
            <p>Traffic management is in place and bus services will continue. Water service remains active to the surrounding area.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington's ageing pipe network is regularly subject to pipe bursts and leaks, with more than 40 percent of the water predicted to be lost every day.</p>
