            <p>Kaipara Harbour Remediation is a project of dizzying numbers - a total budget of around $200 million, of which $100m is from government coffers; 1,880,000 trees planted as of the end of June; 800km of waterways fenced off; and more than 700 private landowners involved so far with another 300 keen to get on board... It's goal? To clean up New Zealand's biggest harbour and restore the mauri, or life force, of the harbour. The number of trees planted is expected to reach 2,000,000 this month.</p>

            <p>Feeling homesick after relocating to New Zealand, three former Hong Kong residents converted an old Toyota Crown Comfort into a lookalike taxi that can be found on almost any postcard from the Asian metropolis. The result is astonishing, if the reaction from locals is anything to go by. "We're trying to bring a smile to people when they see the taxi here in New Zealand because it's supposed to be in Hong Kong," creator Peter Saengdee says.</p>

            <p>The country's largest re-vegetation programme on private land has just planted its eight millionth tree. The Taranaki Regional Council launched its award-winning Riparian Management Programme with a single tree in 1996. Some 28 years later, 5385 kilometres of planting has taken place alongside hundreds of rivers and streams across the Taranaki plain in one of New Zealand's most successful collaborations between farmers, the community and a local authority to improve the quality of freshwater and ecosystems.</p>

            <p>Thousands of anti-racism protesters have rallied in cities and towns across England after a week of anti-immigrant rioting and disorder. Rioting was sparked by misinformation online that the suspect in the fatal stabbing of three little girls in Southport on 29 July was a Muslim asylum seeker. In response, counter-protests have been largely peaceful with people chanting "refugees are welcome here." In Brighton, eight protesters gathered by an office they believed was of a lawyer specialising in refugee law but they were surrounded by 2000 counter-protesters.</p>

            <p>The South Island's oldest working woolshed is getting some much needed repairs after nearly 170 years in operation.</p>
        
            <p>The woolshed on Te Waimate Station in Waimate was built in 1855 by the Studholme Brothers with 100,000 sheep being shorn annually in the 22 shearing stands. Remarkably it's still in use today, however it has started to show its age. In 2022 the back side of the woolshed began to sink, the piles were rotting in the damp ground, beneath a build-up of sheep debris. A Heritage NZ grant will help get the shed back in shape.</p>

            <p>The first Pacific Islander to graduate with a doctoral degree in marine biology from Auckland University of Technology (AUT) says he wants to take everything he has learnt back to his "happy placeâ€¦surrounded by water" and share with his people in Cook Islands. Antony Vavia's research focuses on subsistence fisheries in the Pacific with a case study of his island home of Mitiaro. He said the Cook Islands is surrounded by the ocean and it was "only natural for us to want to take care of that resource".</p>
