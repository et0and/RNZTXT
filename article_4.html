            <p>Mangakahia Road or State Highway 15 has been closed south of Kaikohe due to a major wildfire burning in grass and scrub at Awarua.</p>
        
            <p>At least three helicopters equipped with monsoon buckets and multiple ground crews are fighting the blaze and trying to stop it jumping across Tokawhero Road.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands a building near the corner of Mangakahia and Tokawhero roads is also on fire.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency NZ has set up a command centre on the grounds of the nearby Church of Latter Day Saints on Tokawhero Rd.</p>
        
            <p>Today's blaze in Northland comes just a day after firefighters finished mopping up a wildfire that threatened 20 homes near Waipoua Forest</p>
        
            <p>The latest blaze comes just as firefighters finish mopping up a major fire that threatened 20 homes near Waipoua Forest.</p>
        
            <p>The Waipoua fire, which swept through more than 90 hectares of young pines and slash, started on 26 February when a rubbish fire got out of control. All homes in Waipoua Settlement were saved, but the village's water supply system was destroyed.</p>
        
            <p>Some homes sustained internal smoke damage because residents had no time to close windows as they fled.</p>
        
            <p>All northern and western parts of Northland were now subject to a total fire ban.</p>
        
            <p>Denis Cooper, incident controller at the Waipoua fire, said forestry contractors dealt with the last hotspots on Thursday. Two Fire and Emergency (FENZ) crews monitored the area on Thursday night, and would return regularly over the next week to make sure there were no flare-ups.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ staff also attended a community meeting on Thursday morning with other agencies, including local iwi Te Roroa, the Department of Conservation and the Ministry of Social Development, to ensure Waipoua Settlement residents received the support they needed in the aftermath of the fire.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ Northland manager Wipari Henwood said early indications were that the fire was caused by a rubbish fire that got out of control, but the investigation was still underway.</p>
        
            <p>"We're working really closely with the community and Te Roroa to improve education around fire safety and restrictions. We're developing a response plan for the community, so that if a large fire happens here again, people know what to do to keep themselves and their whānau safe."</p>
