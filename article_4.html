            <p>Police have charged an Auckland man with manslaughter, after an investigation into an incident that occurred while illegal street racing was taking place.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Dean Batey, who is the area investigations manager for Counties Manukau East CIB, said inquiries began after an incident around 11pm on 19 May.</p>
        
            <p>It occurred at the intersection of Bruce Roderick and Offenhauser Drives in East TƒÅmaki.</p>
        
            <p>Around this time a vehicle that was allegedly involved in the illegal street racing struck a spectator, who was pregnant.</p>
        
            <p>"The woman was taken to hospital in a serious condition and emergency surgical procedures were required to be carried out," Detective Senior Sergeant Batey said.</p>
        
            <p>"Tragically, the baby girl did not even survive the day and succumbed to her catastrophic injuries."</p>
        
            <p>The 22-year-old driver was already before the Manukau District Court facing several driving offences, Batey said.</p>
        
            <p>"Today, police have now laid an additional charge of manslaughter against this man."</p>
        
            <p>Batey said both the police and communities were concerned by illegal street racing.</p>
        
            <p>"Time-and-time again, police have issued warnings to those taking part in this illegal activity about the risks they are posing to themselves and others.</p>
        
            <p>"This also extends to the spectators who are enabling this behaviour."</p>
        
            <p>Officers would still like to hear from witnesses who were at the scene, including those who were filming proceedings.</p>
        
            <p>Police have set up an online portal for eyewitnesses to upload any photos or video.</p>
        
            <p>Information can also be provided via the police's 105 phone service, quoting file number 230520/3570, or by contacting Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
