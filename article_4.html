            <p>Two people from the same company, travelling in two separate cars, died in a crash near Oamaru on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The crash involved two staff members of Hilton Haulage.</p>
        
            <p>Hilton Haulage chief executive Dylan Fitzgerald said he was very sad to confirm two of the company's staff died in the accident, just south of Oamaru [ https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/507833/two-dead-after-truck-collides-with-car-near-oamaru].</p>
        
            <p>He said he understood there was a rollover incident involving one of the company's trucks, and the vehicle of another staff member who was travelling privately on a rostered day off.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a terrible tragedy for the families involved and the Hilton Haulage team," Fitzgerald said. "We are all shocked by this terrible coincidence and our deepest sympathies go to both families during this time."</p>
        
            <p>He said they were fully supporting the police in their investigation, and carrying out an internal investigation.</p>
