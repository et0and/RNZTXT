            <p>Iwi representatives in Southland have described the killing of thousands of eels after a man discharged effluent into a local stream as "the worst thing they've ever seen", a court has heard.</p>
        
            <p>The remarks came during the sentencing of Gore man Bryson David Clark, who pleaded guilty to three charges of breaches of the Resource Management Act (RMA).</p>
        
            <p>The charges were for discharging leachate from farm tailings and sileage, and dairy effluent onto land "in circumstances where it could enter water".</p>
        
            <p>Clark appeared via audio-visual link in the Christchurch District Court on Friday in front of Judge Hassan.</p>
        
            <p>Environment Southland launched an investigation after receiving a report of dead eels near Mataura in February 2024.</p>
        
            <p>The judge ordered Clark to pay a fine of $130,000, comply with an enforcement order, and pay legal and court costs totalling $559.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier, Stevie Rae Blair, of Te Ao Mārama Incorporated, delivered a victim impact statement via audio-visual-link.</p>
        
            <p>The group that are made up of representatives of the four local running had helped with the recovery of the tuna.</p>
        
            <p>"It is heartbreaking, one of the worst things I've seen or smelt in my life," she told the court.</p>
        
            <p>"When the environment is disrespected, it disrespects our people."</p>
        
            <p>Judge Hassan later acknowledged the "deep spiritual, cultural and intergenerational harm" that Clark's actions had caused.</p>
        
            <p>"The ecological harm of your actions have been profound and indiscriminate, and will take many years for any recovery to occur," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard that Clark had turned off a Halo water monitoring alarm two months prior due to glitching.</p>
        
            <p>As a result it was not until a farm staffer noticed an effluent overflow of a nearby pond.</p>
        
            <p>Members of the public later reported concerns to authorities as the Low Burn stream was running very high,</p>
        
            <p>The Mataura River was also "running very black", the court heard.</p>
        
            <p>Large concentrations of ammoniacal nitrogen were found following water sampling.</p>
        
            <p>Local iwi also expressed broader concerns about the rehabilitation of the "awa and the species in there".</p>
        
            <p>Eels or tuna are considered both historically important and a present day taonga for Māori,</p>
        
            <p>The eels were found over a 10km span of the Low Burn Stream and made their way down the waterway and into the Mataura River.</p>
        
            <p>It was estimated that at least 4000 eels were killed.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, Te Ao Mārama Incorporated were disappointed in the result.</p>
        
            <p>"This outcome fails to reflect the severity of the harm caused to our waterways and future generations. Tuna are not just another species; they are a vital part of our identity and our responsibility as kaitiaki," said Stevie Rae Blair.</p>
        
            <p>"Hokonui Rūnanga are disappointed in the result which highlights how little our regulatory systems takes into account Ngāi Tahu mahinga kai values and the importance of the environment for all New Zealanders."</p>
        
            <p>"Te Ao Mārama Inc wish to see freshwater values upheld and the river rehabilitated. TAMI encourage the council to direct the fine toward initiatives that support the rehabilitation and long-term health of the river."</p>
