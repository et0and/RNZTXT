            <p>A man who tried to break up a fight over a messy kitchen ended up being fatally stabbed in the neck, while another man was stabbed in the shoulder.</p>
        
            <p>Matthew Williams died and Joseph Pitcaithly was seriously injured in the bloody row on 7 February last year at a shared accommodation run by the Community Living Trust on Clyde Street in Hamilton.</p>

            <p>Bailey Ecclestone, of Hamilton, was charged with murder and injuring with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, which he planned to defend at a trial scheduled to begin on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>But on Friday, the 22-year-old appeared in the High Court at Hamilton and entered a guilty plea to a reduced charge of manslaughter. The murder charge was withdrawn and he also admitted the wounding charge in relation to Pitcaithly.</p>
        
            <p>Details about Williams' death can now be revealed.</p>
        
            <p>According to the Crown's summary of facts, the trust is an organisation that helps adults with additional needs or intellectual disabilities to live in the community.</p>
        
            <p>Support workers live in the residence on 24-hour shifts, with different support workers rostered during the week.</p>
        
            <p>Ecclestone, who has autism and difficulties in social settings, was playing PlayStation in his room when Pitcaithly knocked on his door and confronted him about making a mess in the communal kitchen and for getting a knife stuck in the sink.</p>
        
            <p>He denied the accusations and the pair became embroiled in a loud and heated argument.</p>
        
            <p>Insults were traded until Pitcaithly picked up a plate from the floor and threw it at Ecclestone.</p>
        
            <p>Ecclestone picked up a wooden-handled knife with a serrated blade from the floor of his room and threatened to cut Pitcaithly's neck open.</p>
        
            <p>Pitcaithly replied with words to the effect of "go ahead and do it".</p>
        
            <p>Williams, who was there visiting a friend, heard the commotion and ran upstairs to intervene.</p>
        
            <p>Despite standing in between the pair and trying to defuse the situation, Ecclestone swung his knife over Williams and stabbed Pitcaithly on the top of his right shoulder.</p>
        
            <p>Williams remained standing where he was as Ecclestone swung the knife again.</p>
        
            <p>This time he struck Williams in the neck.</p>
        
            <p>Williams grabbed his neck which was "bleeding profusely", according to the summary, and walked downstairs to ask for help.</p>
        
            <p>He repeatedly said he had been stabbed and to call an ambulance before collapsing on the floor in the kitchen.</p>
        
            <p>Other residents rushed to his aid and tried to staunch the heavy bleeding, as emergency services were called.</p>
        
            <p>Williams died of his 7cm deep stab wound in Waikato Hospital two days later.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Eccleston locked himself in his room and waited for police.</p>
        
            <p>He told them he had acted in self-defence, and acknowledged stabbing both men.</p>
        
            <p>In court, Justice Michael Robinson convicted Ecclestone of the charges and remanded him back into custody ahead of sentencing next month.</p>
