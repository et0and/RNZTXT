            <p>Auckland Council has paid out $1.45 million over a long-running leaky apartment tower saga, but how much it might pay out on other claims is still not settled.</p>
        
            <p>The owners of the Harbour Oaks apartments on Gore Street sued the council for $157m years ago, saying it wrongly signed off on the defect-ridden 40-level, central city block.</p>
        
            <p>The High Court in March upheld six of the 13 claims in full or in part.</p>
        
            <p>The council said the payout it made in August was over a $24m claim about two defects, to podiums and canopy roofs.</p>
        
            <p>Both sides appealed the liability findings, and a hearing on that is due in August 2025.</p>
        
            <p>In addition, a High Court hearing on the size of the liability relating to the other claims is due to be heard in August 2025.</p>
        
            <p>"The council maintains a provision for all active building defect claims, including Gore Street," the council told RNZ.</p>
        
            <p>"As the matter is still before the court, it is not appropriate to make any further comments at this time."</p>
        
            <p>It has set aside $263m in 2024-25 to settle any such claims region-wide, up from $257m.</p>
