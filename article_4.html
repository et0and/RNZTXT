            <p>Wellington City Council did not respond directly to RNZ's inquiry whether the artist was going to play a set.</p>
        
            <p>It said it could not confirm anything until the artist-led announcement.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ was told people have begun buying tickets to Wellington in anticipation of the announcement.</p>
        
            <p>The spokesperson for the Homegrown festival, which was held over the weekend, told RNZ they were not allowed to comment.</p>
