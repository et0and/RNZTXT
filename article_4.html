            <p>A freight plane has landed safely back at Christchurch Airport after an engine failure shortly after takeoff.</p>
        
            <p>The plane, bound for Sydney, alerted the air traffic control tower to the failure shortly after 7pm on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>An airport spokesperson said it had since landed safely.</p>
        
            <p>All three crew who were on board were safe and well, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Engineers were now working on the plane.</p>
        
            <p>There had been no disruption to any other services, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>On Friday, a Jetstar plane slid off the runway while landing at the airport.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed the Airbus A320 experienced a steering problem.</p>
        
            <p>All passengers disembarked safely and there were no reports of injuries.</p>
