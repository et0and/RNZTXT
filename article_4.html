            <p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas as towns across the motu celebrate with decorations, lights and events.</p>
        
            <p>A 'road cone Christmas tree' erected in Wellington represents all the different infrastructure projects under construction, according to the city council.</p>
        
            <p>But for some locals who struggle to get through the city without encountering disruptions, the joke has fallen flat.  </p>
        
            <p>So which New Zealand towns do well in December - generating impressive amounts of Christmas spirit and cheer?</p>
        
            <p>Nelson's Santa Parade Trust chairperson Trevor Marshall said his city would be a strong contender. </p>
        
            <p>"When the float comes around with Santa on it, the eyes of the kids light up," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Marshall became involved in the trust after it fell into financial trouble back in 2016 - the same year the council was criticised for a lack of festive spirit in the town. </p>
        
            <p>The mayor at the time told media she forgot to budget for decorations. But Marshall was determined to turn that around.</p>
        
            <p>"We've completely rebuilt the entire parade. Our whole emphasis is about the spirit of Christmas - not so much the religious aspect. It's about the good will towards other people."</p>
        
            <p>Seven years on, the parade's organisers have lofty ambitions.</p>
        
            <p>"That first year had about 13,000 to 15,000 people. Last year, we had 25,000 people watching the parade," Marshall said. </p>
        
            <p>"It is certainly growing. We know Auckland only got 30 floats in their parade, and Hamilton does 80. Our goal is to be the biggest parade in New Zealand."</p>
        
            <p>This year's parade was the biggest yet, with more than 50 floats.</p>
        
            <p>The city's mayor, Nick Smith, backs Marshall's vision for Nelson at Christmas. </p>
        
            <p>"As the sunshine capital of New Zealand, our council is determined that the 2023 Christmas will be a cracker Christmas," Smith said.</p>
        
            <p>But the 'Most Festive' title is not an easy one to win in Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>Mark Ottoway first brought Christmas lights to Kaiwaka - south of Whangārei - more than 30 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>"My bakehouse was next door to the Anglican church," he said. </p>
        
            <p>"I looked at it one day and I thought, 'that would look good with Christmas lights on it'. After that it snowballed... the pub, the post office, the fish shop - they all had theirs done."</p>
        
            <p>Kaiwaka's display has been through its ups and downs. But it was revived in 2021 by a local residents' group, and the Ottoways still light up their house. </p>
        
            <p>Ottoway spoke to Morning Report producer Emma Ricketts from his basement, where he is building a Christmas village to complete this year's visitor experience.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a lot of fun. We meet people - locals as well as tourists coming through," said.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't do it for recognition or anything, it's a hobby. It's cheaper than playing golf."</p>
        
            <p>Down the other end of the country, in Southland, Riverton is home to one of the nation's longest running Christmas parades - it has run every year since 1946.</p>
        
            <p>In a newer tradition, it hosts an annual "Magical Christmas Doors of Riverton" walk, featuring 80 doors resting among a dense native bush track.</p>
        
            <p>Mayor Rob Scott said these events clearly demonstrated the town's festive spirit.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been described as a small community with a big Christmas heart. It will put a smile on your face - you'd be silly not to come and check it out. I'd say it would easily win best in the country."</p>
        
            <p>Christmas isn't really about competition, but it can be tempting to better others. </p>
        
            <p>Masterton Mayor Gary Caffell acknowledged other places do well, but he backed his Wairarapa town. </p>
        
            <p>"I'm a former resident of Gore. Gore is always thriving around Christmas, but it's nothing like what Masterton has."</p>
        
            <p>Gore Mayor Ben Bell disagreed. </p>
        
            <p>"Gore definitely does it better," he said. "I've only been to Masterton to drink wine."</p>
        
            <p>Two local governments, throwing some Christmas shade at the most festive time of the year.</p>
