            <p>A taste of summer is around the corner with a warm day on the way for many, especially those along the east coast of both islands.</p>
        
            <p>MetService says it's all due to a ridge of high pressure sitting over the North Island bringing settled weather and warmer temperatures for many.</p>
        
            <p>"Maximum temperatures across the country are expected to climb into the mid-to-late twenties in eastern areas, even reaching 31 degrees Celsius in Hastings on Thursday," MetService meteorologist Dom Barry says.</p>
        
            <p>"Above average temperatures will also be felt overnight, with warm and muggy nights on the way for many areas, some places like Auckland only cooling to 16°C."</p>
        
            <p>It is not only Hastings residents who will be warm tomorrow.</p>
        
            <p>MetService is forecasting some warm temperatures for the Hawke's Bay and Tai Rāwhiti regions with Havelock North also set to reach a high of 31degC, Gisborne 29degC and Napier 28.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay farmers will not be happy to read the latest forecast. After one of the driest springs in decades they are selling off livestock and finding that crops are failing to strike.</p>
        
            <p>Several other North Island cities will reach 24-26degC including: Whangārei, Hamilton, Rotorua and Tauranga.</p>
        
            <p>Warmer temperatures will begin to affect the east of both islands on Wed, but the warmest temperatures will occur on Thursday thanks to gusty westerly windsWhile these maps show where temperatures >25°C are possible, Hawke's Bay and Canterbury may see isolated 30°C on Thursday pic.twitter.com/HB5P3WQTfY</p>
        
            <p>In Te Waipounamu Christchurch is forecast to reach a high of 28 as norwesters sweep in for the first day of the cricket test between the Black Caps and England at Hagley Oval.</p>
        
            <p>Further down the coast Ashburton, Timaru and Dunedin will see 27.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a heavy rain watch is in place for Fiordland from midnight through until 6pm on Thursday.</p>
