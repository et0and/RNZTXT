        <h2>Te Kōhao Health celebrates 30 years of serving Hamilton</h2>
        <p>
When the kaupapa Māori health clinic started, people would barter or pay with eggs. Now, it helps more than 8500 whānau.

            <p>Decades on from starting as a 'one stop shop' for out-of-towners, a kaupapa Māori health clinic is celebrating 30 years of serving the Hamilton community.</p>
        
            <p>In 1994, Te Kōhao Health was just a seed on the Kirikiriroa marae - now it is a staple for Hamilton.</p>
        
            <p>It was a dream sparked from Te Arikinui Te Atairangikaahu and Tā Ross Jansen to provide healthcare for people who were not from Tainui, but lived in the area.</p>
        
            <p>When Lady Tureiti Moxon became a board member in 1997, the group was only able to serve "a handful of whānau".</p>
        
            <p>"We didn't have any money, and just like today we have to generate our own income. It was very small beginnings."</p>
        
            <p>Back in the early years, no one paid with money.</p>
        
            <p>"You had people who paid with eggs, you had a bit of bartering, there was a bit of this and a bit of that, there was no money exchanged."</p>
        
            <p>The clinic had one part-time doctor and a practice nurse until staff and contracts trickled its way.</p>
        
            <p>Te Kōhao now serves more than 8500 whānau with both western and Māori models.</p>
        
            <p>"And we're growing. We have a big workforce, and we're developing our workforce so we can better serve our people."</p>

            <p>While the health system was based around clinicians, Moxon said the focus needed to be brought back to the people.</p>
        
            <p>So, she went to the Waitangi Tribunal.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact was that we were underpaid, and we have been underpaid for years as Māori providers - even to this day, it hasn't ever been resolved," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Much of the whawhai (fight) was really to bring a much more equitable system."</p>
        
            <p>Māori had the greatest need out of any ethnicity in this country, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Like many kaupapa Māori health organisations, Te Kōhao Health stepped up to help during the Covid-19 pandemic, providing a testing station on the marae, vaccinations, and support to more than just those on its records.</p>
        
            <p>"The beautiful thing about it was we just about vaccinated half of Hamilton," Moxon said.</p>
        
            <p>"And lots of people who came have never been on a marae before. Nobody felt like they didn't belong, and nobody felt as though they weren't important."</p>
        
            <p>She said health should move away from a system based around clinicians, and go back to being based around the people.</p>
        
            <p>"In order for us to change that paradigm, we all have to find our own solutions. The solution doesn't lay with the government, it lays in the communities.</p>
        
            <p>"There needs to be a more balanced partnership between Māori and the crown and that's always been my view under te Tiriti o Waitangi."</p>
        
            <p>To drive long term sustainability, Māori health support systems needed to become self-reliant - just like Te Kōhao's humble beginnings, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Te Kōhau still works from Kirikiriroa marae but has since moved on from collecting eggs for healthcare, and now provides imaging and outpatient services.</p>
        
            <p>To celebrate three decades, there will be speeches, a book presentation by Ngāti Hauā, and the cake will be cut by patron Te Makau Ariki Te Atawhai Paki, wife of the late Kiingi Tūheitia Pōtatau Te Wherowhero VII.</p>
        
            <p>"First the AGM then the birthday party," Moxon said.</p>
