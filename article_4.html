            <p>Bus lanes will be monitored by cameras on three high traffic streets in Wellington City from Monday.</p>
        
            <p>The cameras on Riddiford Street, Adelaide Road in Newtown and Chaytor Street in Karori, will monitor vehicles using the bus lanes.</p>
        
            <p>It is part of a rollout of bus lane cameras started by Wellington City Council last year, intended to boost the reliability and efficiency of bus services along the city's busiest commuter routes.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists caught on camera driving for more than 50 metres in a bus lane could be issued with a $150 fine.</p>
        
            <p>Road users were advised to check signage for when bus lanes were in effect and whether the lane was a regular bus lane or a bus-only lane.</p>
        
            <p>Bus lanes can be used by bikes, mopeds, motorbikes, and in-service taxis. Other vehicles can use a bus lane for a maximum of 50m to turn left into another street or driveway. </p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, bus-only lanes can only be used by buses. </p>
        
            <p>Emergency vehicles responding to an emergency are the only exception.</p>
        
            <p>Fixed cameras have also been installed on Lambton Quay and Cambridge Terrace but were not yet in operation.</p>
