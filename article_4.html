            <p>A worldwide shortage of ADHD medicines could mean New Zealand patients will struggle to get their usual brand or be forced to wait for supplies, Pharmac says.</p>
        
            <p>In a written statement on its website, the government drug-buying agency said it was working closely with suppliers and clinicians to manage an ongoing, global issue affecting methylphenidate.</p>
        
            <p>Methylphenidate is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) and narcolepsy.</p>
        
            <p>"Rising demand for methylphenidate coupled with overseas manufacturing issues have led to ongoing problems with supply of the medicine," Pharmac said.</p>
        
            <p>"Australia and the United Kingdom are also experiencing supply issues with methylphenidate."</p>
        
            <p>The problem was likely to continue for the rest of the year.</p>
        
            <p>"There may be periods in 2025 where people will not be able to get the brand of methylphenidate they normally use. There may also be times where people have to wait for more stock to arrive at their local pharmacy."</p>
        
            <p>Doctors had been asked to prioritise children and adolescents for getting methylphenidate as they tended to "tolerate" it better than some of the alternative medicines available for ADHD.</p>
        
            <p>Pharmac is asking clinicians to consider prescribing other brands of methylphenidate or other types of medicines for people with ADHD or narcolepsy where possible.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, suppliers and wholesalers were limiting the amount of stock going to pharmacies.</p>
        
            <p>"So although there might be stock in the country, your pharmacist may not have any stock. Please be patient.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect some people may not be able to access their usual brand or form of methylphenidate and alternative treatments will be needed."</p>
