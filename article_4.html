            <p>A brawl of around 200 people, mostly youths, has been broken up in Taitā.</p>
        
            <p>It is just the latest incident in the Lower Hutt suburb after a serious assault on Monday and an hours-long armed stand-off on Tuesday.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the brawl broke out on High Street, around Walter Nash Stadium, on Thursday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Officers broke up the brawl and no charges have been filed.</p>
        
            <p>Police said there would be more officers on the ground in Taitā on Friday in response to the spate of "anti-social behaviour".</p>
        
            <p>A person was left in a critical condition after the Monday assault, while the stand-off saw schools locked down and streets closed.</p>
        
            <p>"Our enquiries have determined these incidents were unrelated and we have dedicated teams investigating both," Hutt Valley area commander Inspector Rob Rutene said.</p>
        
            <p>"This behaviour will not be tolerated by Police and staff will respond and, where appropriate, take enforcement action."</p>
        
            <p>A 26 -year-old man was arrested over Monday's incident.</p>
        
            <p>Police were still looking for two other people understood to be involved, Rutene said.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a 25-year-old man arrested over the Tuesday stand-off appeared in Hutt Valley District Court this week, facing charges of resisting police and using a firearm against police.</p>
