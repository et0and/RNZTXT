        <h2>Watch: 'There's no way I'm going to leave' - a month after the flood</h2>
        <p>
Homes are badly damaged, some are stripped back to timber frames, and residents have big decisions to make.
</p>
        
            <p>Almost a month after June's devasting flood, RNZ visited Wairoa, a town in recovery and demanding answers.</p>
        
            <p>Homes are badly damaged, some are stripped back to timber frames, and residents are forced to decide whether they can rebuild.</p>
        
            <p>One resident has decided not to refurbish while another says she is not leaving her home of 50 years.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ's Ashleigh McCaull and Samuel Rillstone spoke to residents. You can watch what they found at the top of this page.</p>
