            <p>A new wild kākāriki karaka/orange-fronted parakeet population is being established on Pukenui/Anchor Island, with 34 of the critically endangered birds being released.</p>
        
            <p>Pukenui/Anchor Island is located in Fiordland's Dusky Sound and is a predator-free island. The released birds were bred and raised in Christchurch, before taking the long journey south.</p>
        
            <p>Department of Conservation kākāriki karaka operations manager Wayne Beggs told Morning Report the birds have been declared extinct in the past.</p>
        
            <p>"In about 1919 they were first declared extinct, and then rediscovered and then lost again. They were rediscovered in the late 1980s and they have been on a bit of a journey since then.</p>
        
            <p>"The big breakthrough for us has been the captive breeding programme developed by the Isaac Conservation and Wildlife Trust which has enabled us to set up new populations."</p>

            <p>The kākāriki karaka is distinct from other kākāriki species, of which there are five in New Zealand, with the kākāriki karaka being the rarest.</p>
        
            <p>The bird is a cavity nester, which makes them highly vulnerable to introduced predators.</p>
        
            <p>According to Beggs, the key thing for increasing the population of the bird is a predator-free environment, which is what makes Anchor Island the perfect place for the new population.</p>
        
            <p>"Anchor [Island] provides a safe haven for them to breed and build up a sizeable population."</p>
        
            <p>There is also a sizeable population of the bird in Nelson, in another predator-free sanctuary.</p>
        
            <p>"Three-years ago we released kākāriki karaka into the Brook Waimārama sanctuary in Nelson. It's about 700 hectares of beech forest and they have done very well there in a pest-free environment. There are about 200-250 birds there currently from a founding population of about 100."</p>
        
            <p>Critically endangered means less than 1000 birds self-sustaining. Currently there are around 400 kākāriki karaka in the wild, and the population on Anchor Island is helping to move the bird off the critically endangered list.</p>
