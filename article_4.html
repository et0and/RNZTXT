            <p>The Transport Agency is urging drivers in Hawke's Bay and Tai Rāwhiti to be extra cautious over the next few days, as heavy rain and wind batter the regions.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said the rainfall over the next day and a half could be similar to what the regions had seen in June or exceeding that.</p>
        
            <p>Orange heavy rain warnings are in place from 10am Tuesday until 12pm Wednesday for Gisborne and from 10am Tuesday until 9pm Wednesday for Hawke's Bay, north of State Highway 5.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay about and south of SH5 had a orange heavy rain warning in place from 11am Tuesday until 3pm Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi said crews would be closely monitoring state highways while the warnings were in place. People should adjust their speed and following distance when necessary and be alert for flooding, debris on roads, and short-notice road closures.</p>
        
            <p>Uawa Tolaga Bay Civil Defence is warning State Highway 35 at Rototahi, south of the town, is at risk of flooding.</p>
        
            <p>The road was still passable for now, but people should plan their travel carefully, they said.</p>

            <p>MetService meteorologist Clare O'Connor said current models predict the heaviest rainfall would hit this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Gisborne could see peak rainfall at a rate of 25 millimetres per hour, she said.</p>
        
            <p>Orange strong wind warnings were also in place there, with severe gale southerlies gusting at 120km/h in exposed places.</p>
        
            <p>There is also a strong wind watch for Bay of Plenty, east of Whakatāne, from 3pm on Tuesday until 6am on Wednesday.</p>
        
            <p>Further periods of rain or showers were forecast through the remainder of Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, but MetService said intensities and amounts were expected to be much lower.</p>
        
            <p>People were advised to clear drains and gutters ahead of heavy rain, avoid low-lying areas and drive with caution.</p>
