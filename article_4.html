            <p>For decades, scientists have been working on a methane-reducing vaccine for cows with little success, until now.</p>
        
            <p>A prototype vaccine by US-based start-up ArkeaBio, in partnership with Aotearoa's AgriZeroNZ, is showing promise following a trial with 10 cows that saw emissions drop by up to 15 percent.</p>
        
            <p>ArkeaBio founder and CEO Colin South told Saturday Morning they were the first to publish successful results.</p>
        
            <p>"No one's ever shown previously that you're able to use a vaccine to mitigate methane.</p>
        
            <p>"At the moment, we're getting around 13-15 percent reduction over an extended period but both the efficacy and the timeline that it remains in effect for aren't yet long enough."</p>
        
            <p>South said there were no side effects for the cows.</p>
        
            <p>"Methane production is purely from an organism that's a scavenger - it picks up stray hydrogens from CO2 and turns it into methane, it's not totally required for the animal's normal function."</p>
        
            <p>In fact, the metabolic energy needed to produce that methane could be redirected to help the cow get more energy out of food instead.</p>
        
            <p>The burps and farts of farm cows around the globe were a major contributor to methane pollution, and South said atmospheric methane was a highly potent greenhouse gas.</p>
        
            <p>"Although atmospheric methane degrades into CO2 in 12 years... it's something like 84 times the warming impact of carbon dioxide and since 1990 the levels in the atmosphere have doubled."</p>
        
            <p>South said 30 percent of the current annual warming of the climate was due to methane.</p>
        
            <p>"The annual emissions by cattle, sheep and deer, which we call enteric methane, make up about 6 percent of annual greenhouse gas emissions. It's about 3 billion tonnes a year of CO2, so it's a pretty substantial number about equal to that of the methane leaks from fossil fuels or four times as many emissions as the airlines' CO2 can give us."</p>
        
            <p>Of the 1.2 billion cattle in the world, the major players were Brazil, Argentina and India, South said.</p>
        
            <p>"Between those three countries, you've got more than 60 percent of the world's cattle."</p>
        
            <p>South said a methane reducing vaccine would complement other innovations in the climate change space, such as methane-reducing grass.</p>
        
            <p>He said the company was hoping to have its first commercial methane-reducing vaccine ready in two to five years' time.</p>
