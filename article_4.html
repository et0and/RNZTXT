            <p>People are being urged to stop attempting to feed kea after five were killed on a South Island road.</p>
        
            <p>The Department of Conservation (DOC) says five kea have been hit and killed by vehicles on a popular stretch of road in Milford Sound since April.</p>
        
            <p>The deaths were "gutting" for everyone - and could be prevented if people just stopped trying to entice them onto the road with food.</p>
        
            <p>DOC senior ranger of biodiversity Lydia McLean said kea were charismatic and naturally curious parrots.</p>
        
            <p>"Which is why people love seeing them on their journeys so much. However, deliberately enticing them closer by offering them food or other lures is having devastating consequences.</p>
        
            <p>"Not only is human food bad for them but feeding disrupts their natural foraging and draws them towards the road where they are at risk of being run over. Sadly, that is what occurred here."</p>
        
            <p>DOC said the majority of deaths happened at Monkey Creek.</p>
        
            <p>Their deaths had been confirmed as being caused by blunt force trauma - they were otherwise healthy birds.</p>
        
            <p>McLean suggested people slow down when driving around kea.</p>
        
            <p>"Take care as you pull away from stopping areas; they don't move out of the way as fast as you would think, and never drive away if a kea is on your vehicle.</p>
        
            <p>"Remind others that feeding kea is harmful both for their health and because it encourages more scavenging behaviour and leads to more kea on the road and in harm's way."</p>
