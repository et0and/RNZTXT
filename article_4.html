            <p>Three homes were evacuated due to a wildfire in north Canterbury on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters were called to a vegetation fire at Masons Flat in Hurunui, about 90km north of Christchurch, just before 1am.</p>
        
            <p>Crews from 14 fire brigades were deployed to bring the blaze under control.</p>
        
            <p>The fire is now contained and one household has returned while the other two are waiting until fire-damaged trees have been felled.</p>
        
            <p>In March, one person died in a house fire north in Hurunui.</p>
        
            <p>The risk of wildfire is high in rural Canterbury, despite heavy rain forecasts across the South Island, Fire and Emergency response coordinator Brian Keown said.</p>
        
            <p>Banks Peninsula, Christchurch City, and most of the Canterbury High Country are still in a prohibited fire season. Canterbury Plains north of the Rakaia River is in a restricted season.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not unusual for us to be dealing with flooding in one part of our region and fires in another," Keown said.</p>
        
            <p>"It's understandable that people might see the rain warnings and think that the wildfire risk has finished, but what happened in Hurunui overnight is a clear reminder that the threat remains for now."</p>
