            <p>A 29-year-old man has been charged with abduction after an incident in Auckland on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>Police say on 29 March a couple travelling on Sheehan Avenue, Papakura stopped their car when they saw an incident taking place on the footpath.</p>
        
            <p>"It didn't look right to them, and they stopped their vehicle to offer the woman assistance and, in the process, disturbed the alleged offender's actions," Detective Senior Sergeant Simon Taylor said.</p>
        
            <p>They called 111 and gave police a location and licence plate number as well as a photo of a vehicle, he said.</p>
        
            <p>At the weekend police identified the victim who had been through a "harrowing ordeal" but did not suffer serious physical injuries.</p>
        
            <p>A search warrant was also carried out.</p>
        
            <p>A 29-year-old man was remanded in custody to reappear Tuesday at the Manukau District Court.</p>
        
            <p>"I would like to acknowledge their actions last week; for seeing something and doing something about it," Taylor said.</p>
        
            <p>"Quick reporting and good information have been invaluable for our investigation staff to the point where we have now put someone before the court.</p>
        
            <p>"Their actions have prevented any further offending or harm taking place."</p>
