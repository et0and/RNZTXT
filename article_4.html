            <p>Quad bike deaths could be on track to being the highest since 2015 if they continue at their current rate, says a health and safety organisation.</p>
        
            <p>On Saturday night, a man died after his quad bike rolled on a rural property in Waihao Downs, near Waimate.</p>
        
            <p>It is at least the third quad bike fatality this year; a boy died after a quad bike and motorbike crashed at a Warkworth residence in February, and there was another death in March on a private property in Hastings.</p>
        
            <p>There were four deaths in December 2023 alone.</p>
        
            <p>Safer Farms chairperson Lindy Nelson said the death was devastating, and there seemed to be a worrying trend.</p>
        
            <p>"This year seems particularly high in terms of fatalities on quad bikes," Nelson said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have had an unseasonable amount of deaths on quad bikes since spring last year, and they seem to be continuing," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"As an industry, we have all pulled together and started the work to look at what are the preventative factors, and how do we, as farmers, address these incidents."</p>
        
            <p>Some of their members have addressed the vehicle harm by switching to side-by-side vehicles, installing rollover protection on their quad bikes, and limiting their speed as well as being vigilant in when and where the bikes were used.</p>
        
            <p>WorkSafe said it had not yet been notified of the death, which may be because it was a recreational incident and not work-related.</p>
        
            <p>In 2015, there were nine quad bike fatalities reported to WorkSafe, the highest number since 2006 when the reported data began.</p>
