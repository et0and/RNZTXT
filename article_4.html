            <p>Fire crews have contained a vegetation fire inland from Ōtaki Beach, on the Kāpiti Coast, on Saturday night.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency said in a statement it was alerted to the fire, behind the former Ōtaki Health Camp, just after 5pm on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>It burnt through about 5ha of heavy scrub, which Fire and Emergency (FENZ) said made firefighting efforts challenging.</p>
        
            <p>Some people reported they could see it from as far away as Paraparaumu - a distance of 14km.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ said the top priority was keeping the fire away from houses and this had been successful.</p>
        
            <p>Three rural fire crews have been monitoring hot spots overnight, along with a FENZ Drone Team.</p>
        
            <p>Crews will be back on the fire ground on Sunday to put the fire out completely.</p>
