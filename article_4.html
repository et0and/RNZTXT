            <p>An Auckland woman has blown one of the highest breath-alcohol levels ever recorded by New Zealand police.</p>
        
            <p>A member of the public called police after spotting the 36-year-old behind the wheel in Whang훮rei, Northland, last month.</p>
        
            <p>A roadside test revealed a breath-alcohol level of 2178 micrograms, almost nine times the legal limit.</p>
        
            <p>Police say she been staying at Whang훮rei Heads but drove to Corks Road in Tikipunga - a distance of more than 30km - after an argument.</p>
        
            <p>She was taken to Whang훮rei Police Station where her licence was suspended for 28 days. She is due in court next month.</p>
        
            <p>Northland road policing manager Anne-Marie Fitchett said no one wanted to share the road with impaired drivers.</p>
        
            <p>"This amount of alcohol is staggering," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Staff have been committed to carrying out a large number of checkpoints across the district and our EBA [excess breath alcohol] and drugged driver apprehensions are high as a result.</p>
        
            <p>"Good police work, combined with public support will make a difference over time. This is a long game where we are trying to change intergenerational behaviours," Fitchett said.</p>
        
            <p>The legal limit for drivers aged 20 and over is 250 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath. For a blood test the limit is 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.</p>
        
            <p>Drivers aged under 20 are subject to a zero limit.</p>
        
            <p>The highest breath-alcohol level recorded in 2023 was 1977 micrograms - eight times the limit - by a man in Waitemat훮.</p>
        
            <p>Police statistics show alcohol, along with speed and failing to wear seatbelts, remains a major cause of road deaths in Northland.</p>
