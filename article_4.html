            <p>Insanely popular Australian children's band, The Wiggles, will be headlining a dedicated dance festival for toddlers in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>The Wiggles members John (in purple), Tsehay (the youngest member wearing yellow) and one of the original crew Anthony (in blue) will headline The Sound System Dance Party, at Baypark Arena in Mount Manunganui on 5 January, 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The rave will feature DJ Dorothy (aka Dorothy the Dinosaur) on the decks alongside DJ Lenny Pearce, who produced an album of dance remixes to Wiggles classics like Hot Potato and Henry the Octopus.</p>
        
            <p>The album, The Wiggles' Sound System: Rave of Innocence hit number one on the Australian dance music chart.</p>
        
            <p>Event promoter, Mitch Lowe, is the brains behind festivals like Bay Dreams, Mardi Gras and Soundsplash. The arrival of his daughter Kya, inspired a wing of the event's company catering to little kids - K.Y.A (Kind Young Adults).</p>
        
            <p>"There is nothing that makes you happier than a smiling toddler, dancing, loving their life and I am proud we get to offer this experience to 5000 people here in Mount Maunganui," Lowe said in announcing the event.</p>
        
            <p>"Make no mistake, this event is going to be fun for adults too. I've designed events for adults for 15 years and want to make sure this a night to remember for everyone involved.. So bring the family."</p>
