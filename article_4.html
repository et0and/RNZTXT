            <p>A prisoner who escaped custody during a visit to Waikato Hospital on Monday afternoon is still at large.</p>
        
            <p>Although police said 48-year-old Damon Anderson was not considered an immediate risk to the public, they still urged people not to approach him, and instead report any sightings by calling 111.</p>
        
            <p>Anderson was last seen wearing green shorts and was shirtless.</p>
        
            <p>On Monday, Spring Hill general manager Scott Walker said Anderson was handcuffed and wearing a GPS monitor when he escaped.</p>
        
            <p>Police could not say what time the GPS tracker went off due to operational reasons.</p>
        
            <p>Walker said public safety was the prison's top priority and any escape was unacceptable.</p>
        
            <p>An immediate review into the latest incident would be carried out, as well as a review into last month's escape.</p>
        
            <p>"...We will be looking at what changes can be made to operational processes in light of the findings when they have been completed," Walker said.</p>
        
            <p>"Any escape is unacceptable and we are absolutely committed to learning from the reviews and doing everything we can to prevent a similar event from ever occurring again."</p>
        
            <p>Anderson was at the hospital for "medical oversight", Corrections said.</p>
        
            <p>They could not elaborate due to privacy reasons and it was unclear whether Anderson received any treatment before he absconded.</p>
        
            <p>It is also unclear whether the escape was pre-planned or opportunistic.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand said it was working with police and corrections to ensure prisoners did not escape custody while at hospital in future.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, dramatic footage emerged showing how Anderson pulled off the daring escape when he climbed down the side of a hospital building.</p>
        
            <p>The video showed Anderson climbing down a large pipe on the outside of what appears to be the delivery suite adjoining the Elizabeth Rothwell Building, on the north-eastern side of the Waikato Hospital campus.</p>
        
            <p>Near the bottom he jumped to safety and jogged around a coroner onto a footpath in the direction of Selwyn Street, wearing only a pair of shorts.</p>
        
            <p>A Corrections spokesperson maintained Anderson was handcuffed during the visit though his hands were visibly free in the footage, which appeared to have been taken by someone in a neighbouring hospital building.</p>
        
            <p>In the footage Anderson can be seen wearing a GPS monitoring bracelet on his left ankle.</p>
        
            <p>The Elizabeth Rothwell Building houses women's and children's wards along with geriatric and rehabilitation departments, and adjoins the delivery suite and maternity ward.</p>
