            <p>The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) is urging holidaymakers to find out emergency information for the places they are travelling to.</p>
        
            <p>Director of emergency management John Price said visitors should make sure they know local radio frequencies and where to find Civil Defence information.</p>
        
            <p>It was also important to remember that some places will not have mobile coverage, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Despite the thunderstorms and heavy rain seen in some areas, the El Niño weather system also brought the risk of very hot and dry conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"El Niño is likely to bring increased fire danger, heatwaves and a heightened risk of drought. It's really important to adhere to all fire and water restrictions, wherever you're spending your holiday."</p>
        
            <p>And while many people would be heading to the beach to cool off, NEMA's recent research had shown that knowledge of what to do in a tsunami had fallen.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a big worry, because in a locally generated tsunami, the first waves could arrive in minutes. So, immediate evacuation is key to the survival of you and your whānau. This is why it's so important to know and remember Long or Strong, Get Gone," Price said.</p>
        
            <p>"If you are near the coast, if you feel an earthquake that is long - longer than a minute, or strong - it's hard to stand up, get gone - don't wait for an official warning.</p>
        
            <p>"Move immediately to high ground or as far inland as possible. You can check NEMA's national tsunami evacuation map to find out if you live, work, play or holiday in a tsunami zone."</p>
        
            <p>Those going on a classic New Zealand summer road trip should pack up the car with everything that would be needed - food, water, medication, blankets - if they get stranded on the highway, he said.</p>
