            <p>Passengers expecting the resumption of Auckland's train system were met with cancellations on Tuesday after a power issue.</p>
        
            <p>The train system has been closed for upgrades over the past month.</p>
        
            <p>But commuters hoping to catch the Southern, Eastern and Onehunga lines were met with cancellations and delays at about 7am. The Western Line was unaffected.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport says it's disappointed by the delays, which were caused by an overhead power issue.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said the power issue was the result of teething issues but had been resolved.</p>
        
            <p>Metros general manager Jon Knight said the work programme has been successful and crews had achieved more than anticipated.</p>
        
            <p>But despite rigorous testing, Knight said there was still a minor power issue on a section of the Southern Line early Tuesday morning.</p>
