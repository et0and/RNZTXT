            <p>A glitch with Auckland International Airport's check-in system on Thursday night has been fixed.</p>
        
            <p>A spokesperson for the airport said the check in system ran into technical difficulties due to an external digital system it used, causing delays for travellers.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly before 9pm, the spokesperson said the issues had been resolved and check-in had returned to normal.</p>
        
            <p>"There were queues at the check-in but these have now been cleared."</p>
        
            <p>Staff across the airport were working hard to process travellers quickly through departures and get them on board their flights as soon as possible, the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier today there was a confirmed issue with Microsoft 365 which meant many New Zealand customers couldn't access Outlook and Teams. Those services had come back online by 10am Thursday.</p>
