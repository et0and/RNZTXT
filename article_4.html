        <h2>Defence Force apologises for high levels of lead in town's water</h2>
        <p>
The Defence Force admitted it failed to tell residents about high levels of lead and aluminium found in Waiouru's drinking water.

            <p>The Defence Force has apologised for what it says is 'confusion and distress' it caused people in Waiouru, after failing to tell them high levels of lead and aluminium were found in the water.</p>
        
            <p>Its tests reported back on 23 January, showed that aluminium was up to five times officially acceptable levels - at 5.12g/m³ compared to the maximum acceptable level of 1.0g/m³, and lead at 0.016g/m³ against a 0.01g/m³.</p>
        
            <p>But the Defence Force did not tell locals until almost a week later, due to what it called "a well-intentioned, but incorrect decision".</p>
        
            <p>Water and health authorities told it the health risk to consumers was minimal - the Defence Force said the aluminium level was less than what could be found in a cup of tea.</p>
        
            <p>It had been flushing the system and levels had since dropped below the thresholds, it said.</p>
        
            <p>"The initial community advisory did not contain the test results themselves, nor an explicit warning that the levels were above."</p>
        
            <p>"The NZDF sincerely apologises for the confusion and distress caused to the Waiouru community as a result of this incident, and we hope our improved response on this particular issue, and any future ones, will help to rebuild their trust," said head of the estate and infrastructure, Mark Brunton in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy metal levels around the Waiouru base have come into question before due to ammunition used in exercises.</p>
        
            <p>But in this case, Brunton said it was still investigating the cause though "it is believed to have originated from the water treatment process, which involves a common aluminium compound being added to help purify the water".</p>
        
            <p>While the high lead level was most likely due to the test sample itself being contaminated, he said.</p>
