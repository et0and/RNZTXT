            <p>A little blue penguin that made headlines around the world after stopping flights at Wellington Airport has been released back into the wild.</p>
        
            <p>The flightless bird was spotted on the scorching 50C runway by an Air Chathams pilot waiting to take off on Friday 12 January.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Airport wildlife officer Jack Howarth had described the kororƒÅ, which had to be rescued, as being in a less-than-impressed mood.</p>

            <p>Since then the penguin, dubbed Manu, has been in the care of Wellington Zoo.</p>
        
            <p>The zoo said the penguins were known to live in natural nests at nearby Lyall Bay, and there was a high chance the fledgling simply got lost on its way home.</p>
        
            <p>But it was waiting until the Manu's feathers were waterproofed before releasing it back into the wild.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Zoo senior veterinarian Kirsten Anderson said in releasing Manu on Friday, they opted to place him in a nest box in the area to provide him a "quiet space to acclimatise before he sets back out to sea."</p>
        
            <p>The penguin had also been microchipped and the area where he was released was monitored weekly.</p>
        
            <p>Teo Mariette from Wellington Airport said although they usually tried to avoid visits from wildlife on the runway, the visit from the penguin had been a "special one".</p>
