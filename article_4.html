            <p>Dunedin police are investigating a wallaby being burned in a couch fire during student St Patrick's Day celebrations.</p>
        
            <p>Police believed the wallaby had been dead for a period of time before being burned.</p>
        
            <p>University of Otago student services director Claire Gallop said St Patrick's Day festivities brought an influx of students from other tertiary institutions into Dunedin.</p>
        
            <p>"Unfortunately, the issue of interlopers in North Dunedin during St Patrick's Day celebrations continues to be a significant concern and this year has proven no exception," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Some of the behaviour in North Dunedin is incredibly disappointing and it is unfortunate that the actions of a few individuals have led to the association of this behaviour with all University of Otago students.</p>
        
            <p>"Until this weekend there had been no incidents involving couch fires in North Dunedin [this year], but following the influx of weekend visitors it is disappointing this changed."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were assisting Fire and Emergency (FENZ) in relation to couch fires in the Dunedin area.</p>
        
            <p>They were advised that in one instance where a wallaby had been burned, it appeared the animal has been dead for a period of time beforehand, police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are not aware of any animals being harmed relating to these incidents," police said.</p>
        
            <p>Gallop said the University of Otago Student Code of Conduct outlined expectations and potential penalties for breaches but the university had no jurisdiction over those not enrolled at Otago who joined gatherings.</p>
        
            <p>"As in previous years, we carried out educational and harm prevention work with our students in the run up to the day and Campus Watch, residential colleges and student services undertook prevention work on the day working closely with our community partners including Police, FENZ and the Dunedin City Council."</p>
        
            <p>Dunedin police said they were also aware of eight incidents where women were hit in the head by bottles thrown around the crowd during the festivities.</p>
        
            <p>"They were either provided first aid at the scene by police or transported to hospital by ambulance," police said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are unaware of any concussions or serious injuries in relation to these incidents."</p>
