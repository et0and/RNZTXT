            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand says a fire inside a takeaways shop at Auckland's Westgate shopping centre is out now, but a fire investigator remains on site.</p>
        
            <p>Northern Communications shift manager Ryan Geen said 16 firefighters on four appliances attended the blaze on Don Buck Rd just before 2.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Geen said the fire was in a building with other shops and took 20 minutes to bring under control.</p>
        
            <p>Crews from West Harbour, Te Atatu and Henderson attended including one ladder truck.</p>
        
            <p>Geen said there are no injuries to report but police were called to manage traffic control in the area.</p>
