            <p>Hamilton's Rocket Coffee Roasters has been listed in the top 100 coffee shops around the world, ranking at 62nd on the list.</p>
        
            <p>The Hamilton coffee shop is the only one in New Zealand to make the prestigious list.</p>
        
            <p>The store has been around for 30 years and has been a key player in New Zealand's coffee culture through its crafted beverages, friendly atmosphere and strong community ties.</p>
        
            <p>The list is complied by a panel of coffee experts, enthusiasts and industry leaders who rank a variety of factors including dedication to experience, bean sourcing and roasting.</p>
        
            <p>Rocket Coffee co owner Glen Crompton told Morning Report his cafe didn't sell food, just coffee.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't have any other distractions, the focus is on the coffee, so we only sell coffee - we make coffee drinks, we roast coffee, you know, we're here bagging coffee.</p>
        
            <p>"You know, it's really just a coffee destination."</p>
        
            <p>But one of the blends does include Pineapple Lumps Feijoa</p>
        
            <p>"We cut these coffees so , a bit like you might expect at tea tasting with spoons and what not, and then we will throw around flavours that we think we can pick out, so they're not actually flavoured as such but we find these hints of things that we then just go over with our pallet and so that's what we try to get across to our customers," Crompton said.</p>
        
            <p>Rocket Coffee Roasters earned its spot through its commitment to sourcing quality beans and creating a welcoming space for everyone.</p>
        
            <p>The judges said it stood out due to its consistent excellence, unique blends and community-focused atmosphere.</p>

            <p>Crompton said some other judging factors were sustainability and the "vibe of the shop".</p>
        
            <p>He said the roaster even named the farmers as the producers of the coffee on their website.</p>
        
            <p>"It's really important to put the focus back on the farmers cause they are the ones that create the magic."</p>
        
            <p>Crompton said they "throw around flavours" like a tea tasting.</p>
        
            <p>"The coffees are not actually favoured, but we find hints of things that we can then describe with our palettes, and so that what we try to get across to our customers."</p>
        
            <p>"We let the coffees tell their story and their own flavours."</p>
        
            <p>He said he was incredibly proud to represent Aotearoa on the world stage.</p>
        
            <p>"This ranking is a testament to our passion and dedication over the years, and it's a reflection of the hard work and commitment to quality that we put into every cup. We're thrilled to share this achievement with the community that has been behind us from the start."</p>
        
            <p>When asked about the increasing cost of coffees, Crompton said a rebalancing was happening in the industry.</p>
        
            <p>"The farmers do need to be re-paid more and so eventually that will flow through to the consumer."</p>
        
            <p>The top spot was taken out by Toby's Estate Coffee Roasters in Australia.</p>
