            <p>A former funeral director charged with misconduct relating to burials at Auckland's largest cemetery can now be named as Fiona Bakulich.</p>
        
            <p>The 48-year-old appeared at the Auckland District Court on 25 October, facing charges of interfering with human remains and eight counts of obtaining by deception.</p>
        
            <p>An application for name suppression based on mental health grounds was declined by Judge Steve Bonnar.</p>
        
            <p>Bakulich was granted interim name suppression until 5pm on 30 October, pending an appeal.</p>
        
            <p>However her lawyer, Panama Le'Au'Anae, confirmed she was no longer seeking name suppression.</p>
