            <p>Invercargill's mayor is set to return to official duties next week while recovering from heart surgery in early January.</p>
        
            <p>Nobby Clark was admitted to hospital after suffering a heart attack in late December, but said he was feeling good and ready to get back to work.</p>
        
            <p>"It's been a long road to recovery - but I'm well rested and up for the challenges ahead," Clark said.</p>
        
            <p>Council chief executive Michael Day said he was relieved the mayor had made such a remarkable recovery.</p>
        
            <p>"We are heartened by Mayor Clark's enthusiasm to return to his role and welcome him back," Day said.</p>
        
            <p>He thanked deputy mayor Tom Campbell for taking on the mayoral role for the past two months.</p>
        
            <p>"His time and effort have been greatly appreciated by council staff and the greater community."</p>
