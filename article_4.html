            <p>New Zealand and Ireland have proposed a scientific panel be set up to examine the effects of a nuclear war.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement delivered to the United Nations, Ireland's permanent representative Fergal Mythen said the last UN-mandated study was done in 1989.</p>
        
            <p>He said since then, scientific progress has advanced markedly - including climate and data modelling.</p>
        
            <p>Mythen said the 21 experts on the panel would focus on the physical effects and consequences to society of a nuclear war.</p>
        
            <p>He believed the study would also aid nuclear disarmament and arms control.</p>
        
            <p>The comments were posted on the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade website.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, the UN said the resolution was passed by the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) 144-3, with France, Russia and the United Kingdom voting against it and 30 abstentions.</p>
        
            <p>The committee also passed a draft resolution calling on states, "particularly nuclear-weapon states, to commit to further identifying, exploring and implementing effective measures needed to mitigate risks relating to nuclear weapons use that arise from miscalculation, misperception, miscommunication or accidents and, among other steps, to maintain the practice of not targeting each other with nuclear weapons and keep them at the lowest possible alert levels".</p>
        
            <p>That passed 145-6, with China, North Korea, Iran, Nicaragua, Russia and Syria voting against it and 29 abstentions.</p>
