            <p>Police are asking for the public's help to find Manawatū-based Ashleigh Houston, who they want to speak with in relation to a number of Facebook Marketplace scams.</p>
        
            <p>They say she is actively avoiding police.</p>
        
            <p>It is believed she is in the Manawatū area, but she also has links to the Whanganui and Taranaki regions.</p>
        
            <p>Police want to hear from anyone who knows where she is or has any information that may help them find her.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Manawatū, Taranaki, Whanganui-Ruapehu police have warned people of the risks of buying and selling goods on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"In an online environment, it can be difficult to verify the person you are dealing with has good intentions," they posted on Facebook.</p>
        
            <p>"On rare occasions people who have arranged to meet up with someone have been robbed or threatened with violence. This is understandably scary, and a situation no one wants to encounter."</p>
        
            <p>Police say anyone buying or selling on social media platforms should exercise caution, and report any aggressive behaviour.</p>
