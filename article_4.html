            <p>A Professor who has contributed to understanding and improving oral health for more than 40 years says when he found out he was being recognised in the New Year Honours list he thought it was a hoax.</p>
        
            <p>Emeritus Professor Murray Thomson, an extensively published and multi-award-winning oral health researcher, has been made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.</p>
        
            <p>His contributions have been vital to understanding oral health of the ageing population and the effectiveness of dental care in improving the lives of children and families.</p>
        
            <p>Thomson has taught and mentored more than 30 years worth of dental students over the course of his career.</p>
        
            <p>But despite all his work, Thomson said when he first heard he would be recognised it came as a "complete surprise".</p>
        
            <p>"I know it's cliché to say but it's tremendously humbling - it bowled me over."</p>
        
            <p>Thomson was notified of the recognition while he was in a motor home in Tasmania.</p>
        
            <p>"I checked my email and at first I thought it was a hoax, it came as a complete shock. Literally stunned."</p>
        
            <p>Thomson grew up in Huntly and once he graduated from dental school, he went back there to work as a dentist.</p>

Working in Huntly made Murray Thomson realise he wanted to do more research into dental health.

            <p>"From my time there, I've always been acutely aware of oral health and equality and it set me on the path of dental health and epidemiology.</p>
        
            <p>"It made me think there was more I could do rather than doing dentistry on one person at a time. It's been quite a journey since."</p>
        
            <p>He spent time working in public health in the UK before returning to New Zealand and looking at dental health in nursing homes in Manawatū and Horowhenua.</p>
        
            <p>"I've dabbled ever since in the oral health of older people but I was always diverting to other areas, I'm towards the end of my career now and I'm editing a journal on the oral health of older people and it's a very rewarding and interesting thing to do and I'm loving it.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a good way to cap off my career."</p>
        
            <p>Health inequality was political, Thomson said, and there was a narrative that it was easier for society to blame the victims than to actually work out what needed to be done to give people better opportunities.</p>
        
            <p>Thomson said he would not have been given an honour without the help of an "immense" number of people he has worked with over the years.</p>
        
            <p>"I've had the privilege to have a lot of fun doing it throughout my career and it's wonderful to be able to pay it forward by training and mentoring my post graduate students who are now working and researching poor oral health in the community.</p>
        
            <p>"It's great to see people now go on and become the people who are leading the scientific investigations."</p>
