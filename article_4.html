            <p>Thousands of spectators are expected at the 40th anniversary of the Wellington Dragon Boat Festival - one of 15 events happening in the capital this weekend.</p>
        
            <p>Dragon Boat Festival organiser Annika Green said more than a hundred teams or about 2000 competitors are taking part, but the waterfront event is also popular with spectators.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect thousands of them. They really spill up the Wellington waterfront all the way from Queens Wharf to Te Papa."</p>
        
            <p>However, organisers are worried people may fall victim to a scam and have issued warnings to those wanting to view the event's livestream not to be tricked into handing over any payment to view the event online, which is free on the official website.</p>
        
            <p>"The only place to watch the racing is on our website. It's free. It's safe. And we don't want your credit card details," they said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Avoid clicking on any other links. There are a lot of false ones floating around, so don't be fooled"</p>
        
            <p>It comes after scam links were circulated this week, purporting to be the livestream of the funeral held on Thursday for MP Fa'anānā Efeso Collins.</p>
        
            <p>Dragon Boat Festival competitors from throughout the country and from overseas have taken part in a two-month training programme to get ready for this weekend's races.</p>
        
            <p>A fun race day was held on the Wellington waterfront on 10 February, and the competition heats began on Friday, with the remaining heats on Saturday before the finals at 3:30pm. Then a youth competition and schools finals will be held on Sunday.</p>

            <p>On Saturday, Green said there was a fantastic festival atmosphere down on the waterfront.</p>
        
            <p>"We expect people to be coming and going all weekend along. We're buzzing, it's absolutely buzzing, it's been a great day so far."</p>
        
            <p>Other events happening in the capital on Saturday and Sunday include a Brazilian food and music carnival on Willis Street, Pipes in the Park bagpipe festival and the Blackcaps vs Australia test at the Basin Reserve.</p>
