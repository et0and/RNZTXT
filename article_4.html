            <p>A suitcase purchased at an "exorbitant" price by Invercargill City Council for the sole purpose of bringing gifts home from Japan has not been used since.</p>
        
            <p>Last week, the $750 item made headlines after appearing on a council report detailing 'sensitive expenditure'.</p>
        
            <p>Described by council group manager finance and assurance Patricia Christie as a "hard-shell, Samsonite-style case", it was purchased during a trip to sister city Kumagaya in July 2023.</p>
        
            <p>But it drew criticism after the expense was highlighted in a committee meeting by mana whenua representative Pania Coote.</p>
        
            <p>Councillor Ria Bond told Local Democracy it was an "exorbitant" price to pay for a suitcase considering there were people in the city struggling to put food on the table.</p>
        
            <p>Invercargill City Council governance and legal manager Michael Morris confirmed the item had not seen much daylight since last winter.</p>
        
            <p>"The suitcase purchased by Invercargill City Council in Japan last year is being stored at Te HÄ«naki Civic Building, and has not been used since its return," Morris said.</p>
        
            <p>"However, it will be available for future use where required."</p>
        
            <p>
The council confirmed the suitcase has not been used since bringing back the gifts, which are also not on display.

            <p>Christie previously explained the suitcase was purchased at a luggage shop located near the hotel where council delegates stayed in Tokyo.</p>
        
            <p>It was bought in the presence of councillor Barry Stewart, approved by mayor Nobby Clark, and used to bring home two items - a bamboo bowl gifted by the City of Kumagaya and a porcelain plate gifted by the Kumagaya Friendship Association.</p>
        
            <p>Both were deemed too large to travel as carry-on luggage and required a high level of protection due to their delicate nature, Christie said.</p>
        
            <p>Since arriving in Invercargill, the bowl and plate have been stored in council archives alongside other items not currently on display.</p>
        
            <p>The two items were likely to be displayed in the near future, Christie said.</p>
