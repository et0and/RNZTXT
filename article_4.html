            <p>A former Auckland funeral director accused of interfering with human remains faces a number of new charges as police say the investigation into the case is ongoing.</p>
        
            <p>Fiona Bakulich, 48, a former employee of Tipene Funerals, lost name suppression in the Auckland District Court last October.</p>
        
            <p>She was charged with mishandling human remains and nine counts of obtaining by deception.</p>
        
            <p>The charges related to bodies disinterred at Waikumete Cemetery during flooding in 2023.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson confirmed on Thursday she was now facing 14 charges including two of interfering with human remains and 12 of obtaining by deception. Three of those charges were for amounts which totalled over $1000.</p>
        
            <p>The police investigation into the case was ongoing, the spokesperson said and while no further arrests had been made at this point, it could not be ruled out.</p>
        
            <p>"There is no warrant to arrest over this matter," the spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Eleven victims have been identified at this stage."</p>
        
            <p>Bakulich is expected back in the Auckland District Court on 28 February.</p>
