            <p>She said the men at the shelter last night were transferred to another part of the mission's premises.</p>
        
            <p>"It is tragic that this event would happen on our premises.</p>
        
            <p>"We offer our thoughts and prayers to the families of those affected and deeply appreciate the efforts of our amazing staff along with emergency services last night," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The mission's foodbank would be across the road at 275 Hereford Street today and only open for clients who have pre-booked a food parcel.</p>
        
            <p>Haines said its men's day programme, learning and development hub, reception and admin areas would be closed on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>There would also be no alcohol or other drug counselling and social work onsite.</p>
        
            <p>"We will offer full support to all our staff and clients who have been affected," she said.</p>
