            <p>"It's always one of the highlights of the year to see who has won an award and to find out about their mahi and how that is making a difference to Taranaki," said Littlewood.</p>
        
            <p>"And this fantastic work is being done across the generations and by people from all walks of life. Their efforts to keep our place special are truly inspirational and we're delighted to be able to recognise what they've been doing with an environmental award.</p>
        
            <p>"Our mission is to care for Taranaki and it's pleasing to see many others share our passion for preserving our environment and ensuring we're all working together to make the region a better place to live and work."</p>
