            <p>The Far North District Council has changed its te reo title to better reflect the area's traditional M훮ori name.</p>
        
            <p>When the council was formed in the 1989 local government amalgamations, it was given the M훮ori name Te Kaunihera o Tai Tokerau ki te Raki.</p>
        
            <p>However, Mayor Moko Tepania said that was not actually the name M훮ori used for the district.</p>
        
            <p>He said the new te reo name, Te Kaunihera o Te Hiku o Te Ika, restored the area's indigenous name.</p>
        
            <p>Te Hiku o Te Ika translated as "the tail of the fish".</p>
        
            <p>Tepania said it was a small gesture, but one that showed the council was "walking the talk" in its goal of boosting the use of te reo within the organisation.</p>
        
            <p>"Our district has the most te reo speakers per capita anywhere in the country. Last year, I was proud that our council adopted a te reo M훮ori policy. It shows the importance we place on our indigenous language."</p>
        
            <p>Tepania said the Far North District Council would remain the organisation's legal name, and there was no cost to ratepayers beyond staff time required for tweaking the council logo.</p>
        
            <p>The updated logo with the new te reo name would be rolled out first on digital platforms such as the council website and emails.</p>
        
            <p>It would be applied to physical assets, such as signs and stationery, only as they were created or replaced.</p>
        
            <p>Ahead of Waitangi Day commemorations was a fitting time to make the change, he said.</p>
