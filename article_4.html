            <p>A friend of Philip Polkinghorne said she felt manipulated by him after he showed her a supposed suicide note from his wife.</p>
        
            <p>Pauline Hanna was found dead in her Auckland home in April 2021.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne has pleaded not guilty to murdering his wife and staging her death as a suicide.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking at the High Court in Auckland on Wednesday, Alison Ring, a close friend of the couple, said she supported Polkinghorne after Hanna's death and after he was charged with her murder.</p>
        
            <p>Ring said the retired eye surgeon seemed distraught after his wife's death.</p>
        
            <p>"He said: 'I've let her down, I wish I was dead, I wish I was with her'."</p>
        
            <p>Like Polkinghorne, Ring's husband worked as as an ophthalmologist. The couples occasionally had dinner together and had been on work trips to France.</p>
        
            <p>Ring said after Hanna's death, she and her husband wanted to support Polkinghorne and told him he was welcome at their home any time.</p>
        
            <p>She said one evening, Polkinghorne told them a small amount of methamphetamine had been found in his home and that it belonged to Hanna.</p>
        
            <p>She said she told him: "Do you expect me to believe that, because I won't".</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne pleaded guilty to possession of the class A drug and possession of a pipe at the beginning of the trial, which is in its third week of six.</p>
        
            <p>Ring said three weeks after his wife died, Polkinghorne said police had found him at a luxury lodge with an escort.</p>
        
            <p>This was devastating to her.</p>
        
            <p>But Ring said what ultimately led her to withdraw support for him was when he showed her a supposed suicide note from Hanna.</p>
        
            <p>She said he told her he found it in linen sheets in a bedroom.</p>
        
            <p>She told the court the note said: Dear P, I love you forever, love P.</p>
        
            <p>Ring said she previously told Polkinghorne she could not believe Hanna did not leave a suicide note.</p>
        
            <p>She said the note Polkinghorne produced was not what she would expect Hanna to write and questioned why he had not given it to police.</p>
        
            <p>"I was very distressed and I had a few sleepless nights over it because it just didn't sit with me."</p>
        
            <p>She said a year before she died, Hanna found out her husband was having an affair after she found "obscene photographs" while going through his computer.</p>
        
            <p>Hanna had revealed this to her at a function at a private members club in Auckland, the Northern Club.</p>
        
            <p>Hanna told Ring her husband was seeing sex workers in Sydney, but she was not accepting of him having an affair with someone in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>She asked Crown prosecutor Brian Dickey if she could quote Hanna, and he said she could.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't care how many prostitutes he f***s in Sydney. I will not tolerate him having an affair with someone in my space."</p>
        
            <p>According to Ring, Hanna said she would leave her husband of 20 years if he did not end his affair and she planned to see a lawyer and sort out her finances.</p>
        
            <p>In June 2020, at a dinner also at the Northern Club, Ring said Hanna also confided in her that Polkinghorne was "erratic, difficult to live with, and verbally abusive".</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne was extremely agitated about a conflict at his workplace, Auckland Eye.</p>
        
            <p>"He said if they listened to him they wouldn't have lost so much money."</p>
        
            <p>The last time Ring spoke to Hanna was a few weeks before her death at a celebration of life for their friend.</p>
        
            <p>They spoke about an upcoming couples' trip to the South Island they had planned together.</p>
        
            <p>"She was so excited for a couple of glasses of wine and a big catch up."</p>
        
            <p>Ring said their discussion then went to Hanna's marriage.</p>
        
            <p>"She told me 'Polk' has been trying hard these last few weeks."</p>

            <p>Another long-time friend said she urged Hanna before she died to leave Polkinghorne.</p>
        
            <p>Victoria (Pheasant) Riordan, who was in her teens when she first met Hanna, said she always had concerns about the relationship.</p>
        
            <p>"From the get go, Philip came across very controlling."</p>
        
            <p>Riordan said her concerns were heightened after an alarming conversation they had at a dinner in early 2020.</p>
        
            <p>At the High Court in Auckland, Riordan demonstrated to Crown prosecutor Alysha McClintock how Hanna told her Polkinghorne had once put his hands around her neck.</p>
        
            <p>"He told her he could do that any time."</p>
        
            <p>Ring said Hanna took this as a real threat that he might strangle her.</p>
        
            <p>Holding back tears, Riordan said she told Hanna to end the relationship but the latter assured her everything was ok.</p>
        
            <p>Polkinghorne's defence lawyer Ron Mansfield KC questioned the long time friend about the alleged strangling threat.</p>
        
            <p>During cross-examination, Riordan told Mansfield KC those words might not have been the exact ones Hanna said Polkinghorne used.</p>
        
            <p>Riordan said the conversation was "so dramatic and alarming she can't remember everything", but that Hanna's inference was clear.</p>
