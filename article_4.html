            <p>Dozens of coastguard volunteers continue to search for a man who disappeared while trying to cross the Cook Strait on a jetski.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguards from Marlborough and Mana were helping police search and rescue to look for the man, who vanished after setting out from the Tasman District on Monday.</p>
        
            <p>His jetski was found at Cook Rock, off the top of the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard had searched Cook Strait, Marlborough Sounds and the Porirua Coast for the man over the past few days.</p>
        
            <p>Coastguard Marlborough president David St John said on Thursday Marlborough volunteers would be joined by Havelock Coastguard, to continue the search.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a big search effort for the team, and tomorrow we have volunteers who are taking days off work - it's just what we need to do," St John said.</p>
