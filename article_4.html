            <p>Three men have been arrested after killing a family dog during a violent home invasion in Kaipara.</p>
        
            <p>Police said one person required surgery after armed perpetrators ransacked an Oruawharo property and assaulted its occupants on Friday morning.</p>
        
            <p>A pet dog was also killed before the men fled the home.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant of Waitematā CIB, Mike Williams, said the trio were arrested in the Bay of Plenty on Sunday after a search which spanned across the upper North Island.</p>
        
            <p>"Early on we had information about persons and vehicles of interest in the investigation travelling into the Rotorua area and onto further locations in the Bay of Plenty."</p>
        
            <p>Williams said police cleared an address in Kawerau, after one vehicle was seen on Sewell Street.</p>
        
            <p>"Armed Police cordoned off the property, before arresting two men nearby who had left the address in a vehicle prior to police arrival."</p>
        
            <p>"The third suspect was located in a vehicle in the car park of a supermarket in Kawerau, and he too was arrested."</p>
        
            <p>He said multiple police districts worked around the clock to identify, locate, and arrest the men.</p>
        
            <p>"We acknowledge the support from our colleagues in the Northland, Waitematā and Bay of Plenty districts in this investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"It's had a profound impact on the victims, one of which has only recently been discharged from hospital after surgery."</p>
        
            <p>The three men aged 27, 29 and 35 will appear in Whakatāne District court today charged with aggravated burglary, commission of a crime with a firearm, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and intentional damage.</p>
        
            <p>Williams said police had not ruled out further arrests and charges.</p>
