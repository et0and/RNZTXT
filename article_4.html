            <p>Fifteen survivors of the Lake Alice child and adolescent unit - the Rangitīkei psychiatric institution where children were tortured in the 1970s - have so far received $150,000 government rapid redress payments.</p>
        
            <p>The payments, announced in December, were open to survivors injected with the painful paralysing drug paraldehyde or who received electroconvulsive therapy.</p>
        
            <p>It was part of a $22.68 million package for Lake Alice survivors, who can either opt for the payments or get a free lawyer and head to arbitration.</p>
        
            <p>The first five rapid payments were made on Monday, and the following 10 throughout the week. Survivors have until September to register their interest.</p>
        
            <p>Last month the government confirmed 77 survivors were eligible for these redress claims.</p>
        
            <p>But, the approach has faced criticism for excluding people who also received electric shocks or were injected with drugs at other institutions.</p>
        
            <p>Robyn Dandy, who was injected with paraldehyde at Lake Alice in 1972, said she'd received her rapid payment money this week.</p>
        
            <p>She has welcomed the payments, saying it allowed her to realise her dream of buying a house bus or similar form of transport and travelling around New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>This was a promise she made to her late grandson Kahn Petch, who was six when he died in a house fire in November 2001.</p>
        
            <p>"I know we deserve a lot more for what we went through," Dandy told RNZ this week.</p>
        
            <p>"I understand that, but I think what the government has offered is more than what I thought we'd ever get.</p>
        
            <p>"I can do things I would no be able to do, otherwise."</p>
        
            <p>Dandy said as well as realising her dream, she could put aside money for a rainy day and in her vet account for her animals.</p>
