            <p>A police investigation is underway following a fire at a New Lynn mosque on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Waitematā CIB detective inspector Callum McNeill says police and fire investigators have established the fire in the Astley Avenue building was deliberately lit.</p>
        
            <p>Security footage showed a person allegedly broke in just before 1am on Monday and lit the fire, which smouldered until just after 9am when it became visible and emergency services were called, he said.</p>
        
            <p>At this early stage, police were still investigating possible motives and could not say whether it was a hate-related crime, McNeill said.</p>
        
            <p>"There will be an increased police presence around mosques throughout Tāmaki Makaurau to ensure the community feels safe," he said.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone who may have seen this incident, or has any information, is urged to contact police and reference file number 241105/3764.</p>
