            <p>Defence lawyers at a Wellington murder trial have accused police of downplaying their response when they arrested the victim on the night of his death.</p>
        
            <p>Karori man Rau Tongia was released by police later that same night in December 2020.</p>
        
            <p>Five women are charged over his death.</p>
        
            <p>Shayde Carolyn Weston, Breeze Hunt-Weston, Louise Kelly Hume, and Pania Ella Waaka have all pleaded not guilty to murder.</p>
        
            <p>Hunt-Weston has pleaded not guilty to additional charges - an accessory after the fact to murder, and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>
        
            <p>The fifth person was due to go on trial but has not appeared due to ill health.</p>
        
            <p>The Crown alleges that in the hours before Tongia's death he assaulted Weston and his death was a revenge killing.</p>
        
            <p>Detective constable Mitchell Murdoch was among the police who responded to a disorder callout on Percy Dyett Dr.</p>
        
            <p>Murdoch told the court that police had been told that a fight had occurred and knives may have been involved.</p>
        
            <p>But he said when clearing Tongia's address there was no evidence of the alleged weapon.</p>
        
            <p>He said Tongia seemed to be asleep when police entered his home and responded to their presence aggressively.</p>
        
            <p>Murdoch said Tongia was arrested, and then later released.</p>
        
            <p>He said Tongia's response was reasonable given the circumstances.</p>
        
            <p>But defence counsel Robert Lithgow said he felt Murdoch was downplaying police's response.</p>
        
            <p>He said they arrived at the address armed with firearms, ballistic armour and a dog handler.</p>
        
            <p>Murdoch said that was fairly standard procedure.</p>
        
            <p>Another witness who was next door told the court she could not remember anything from that night.</p>
        
            <p>Crown lawyer Sally Carter responded by asking her questions from an earlier statement she had given to police.</p>
        
            <p>In the statement, the woman said she was at her sister's birthday party, next door to Tongia's home.</p>
        
            <p>She said Tongia, his partner and Weston all attended the party.</p>
        
            <p>She felt that Tongia and his partner were trying to aggravate each other, which she said the partner did by kissing Weston.</p>
        
            <p>The woman said she later saw Tongia and Weston fight.</p>
        
            <p>She said both appeared to then get knives, and she witnessed Weston throwing a knife into the bushes.</p>
        
            <p>Police later recovered a knife from the bushes.</p>
