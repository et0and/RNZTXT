            <p>A Waikato man with stage three lung cancer is hoping to re-home 40 rescued cats he can no longer look after.</p>
        
            <p>After seeing cats being injured and killed on State Highway 1 near his Tokoroa business, Wayne Proffitt built a massive enclosure and had been looking after and de-sexing hundreds of strays.</p>
        
            <p>But he was now too ill to run his rescue.</p>
        
            <p>Proffitt's daughter Jen Agnew said her dad was grateful people were responding to their Facebook advertisement, but they still had many suitable cats in need of a home.</p>
        
            <p>"He's blown away with the response we've got so far.</p>
        
            <p>"It's heartbreaking for him. He's having to deal with the diagnosis and treatment and trying to sort his cats out.</p>
        
            <p>"They've [the cats] been his priority over the last few years, he's sacrificed a lot for them. But he needs to put himself first."</p>
        
            <p>Re-homing all his cats would be a weight off her dad's shoulders as he needed to travel to Hamilton for treatment, she said.</p>
