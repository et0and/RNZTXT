            <p>A section of the main highway between Motueka and Richmond will be closed for several hours after a serious crash between a car and a motorcycle near Māpua this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The crash occurred around 2.30pm and Hato Hone St John said one person was transported to Nelson Hospital in a moderate condition.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 60 at the intersection with Māpua Drive remains closed while police investigate the incident.</p>
        
            <p>NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi said the road would remain closed while police carried out their work, which was likely to take several hours.</p>
        
            <p>Detours are now in place from Pea Viner Corner via the Moutere Highway and back out to State Highway 60 on Gardner Valley Road.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists are advised to avoid the area and expect delays.</p>
        
            <p>It is the second crash that has occurred on the same stretch of highway today.</p>
        
            <p>Police said the southbound lane of State Highway 60 near Māpua Drive was partially blocked after a two-car crash just after 10am.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John said three patients were assessed at the scene, with one transported to Nelson Hospital in a moderate condition.</p>
