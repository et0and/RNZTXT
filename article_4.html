        <p>

            <p>The aircraft watchdog has found a rope that didn't meet recommended guidelines and human factors likely contributed to a fatal tow-plane crash.</p>
        
            <p>On 7 May, 2022, a tow-plane flown by Ronald Sanders was taking off from the Feilding Aerodrome when a glider being towed made contact with grass.</p>
        
            <p>After take-off, during an attempt to reposition the glider into the correct tow position, the tow rope became slack.</p>
        
            <p>It then re-tensioned which resulted in the glider becoming further out of position, causing the tow plane to lose control and crash into trees.</p>
        
            <p>Sanders died in hospital 12 days later.</p>
        
            <p>A report into the accident by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) found several contributing factors to the crash.</p>
        
            <p>The investigation found that the rope was shorter than the recommended minimum length, which increased the rate at which the problem developed, reducing the reaction time for either pilot to release the tow rope.</p>
        
            <p>It also found that human factors likely contributed to the accident.</p>
        
            <p>The CAA described human factors as the aspects of being human that influence how we make decisions and actions, such as our ability to process information, communicate and adapt to situations.</p>
        
            <p>CAA deputy chief executive Dean Winter expressed condolences to the victim's family in commenting on the report.</p>
        
            <p>"Every time a pilot doesn't make it home is a tragedy and I feel deeply sorry for the family.</p>
        
            <p>"This accident is a sombre reminder for all aviators of how quickly tragedy can strike and how important it is to be aware of risks every time you fly."</p>
