            <p>A woman has given birth on an Air New Zealand flight from Auckland to New Plymouth, RNZ understands.</p>
        
            <p>An Air New Zealand spokesperson said after flight NZ5041 landed in New Plymouth on Wednesday one customer remained on board to receive medical attention.</p>
        
            <p>A passenger at the airport said an ambulance could be seen on the tarmac following the plane's arrival.</p>
        
            <p>The passenger said they were later told by Air New Zealand staff that a woman had gone into labour after the plane landed and the baby was born shortly after.</p>
        
            <p>St John and New Plymouth Airport's Fire Rescue team both said they responded to the medical callout around 3pm.</p>
        
            <p>"One ambulance attended and two patients were transported to Taranaki Base Hospital in a moderate condition," a St John spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand said its crew and other customers onboard acted quickly and showed "real manaakitanga".</p>
        
            <p>"We thank everyone who helped and wish the customer well."</p>
        
            <p>Air New Zealand said the subsequent flight to Auckland NZ5052 was cancelled as a result.</p>
        
            <p>The airline said it put on a "recovery service" Wednesday evening to accommodate customers.</p>
