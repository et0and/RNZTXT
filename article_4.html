            <p>"Concerning" emails continue to be received by schools, hospitals, courthouses, and places of worship across the nation today.</p>
        
            <p>Police say so far more than 70 organisations have reported receiving such emails since yesterday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"We know that these emails are causing real concern among members of our community, particularly the emails directed at places of worship," a statement said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police remain confident that the emails being received are from the same source, and are not targeted at any particular community or group."</p>
        
            <p>Another round of the same threatening emails received by hospitals and a school on Thursday were sent to more organisations this morning.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands four hospitals and one school, Auckland's Saint Kentigern College, were searched by police or evacuated as a precaution yesterday.</p>
        
            <p>A police spokesperson earlier confirmed the same email was sent to another round of organisations today.</p>
        
            <p>Browns Bay School closed "until further notice due to receiving a bomb threat", it said in a message to parents.</p>
        
            <p>Whangaparāoa Primary School also did, saying it too received a bomb threat.</p>
        
            <p>"The emergency procedure is we need to clear everyone away from buildings and not allow people on site, until police clear our site," it said.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland's Ōrewa College also sent a message to parents saying it was closing immediately due to health and safety.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ understands the school may be a target of one of the emails.</p>

            <p>Police said they were confident the emails were being sent from the same source, and did not believe there was any actual threat to the places receiving them.</p>
        
            <p>Any organisations that receives an email is asked to report it to police to help with the ongoing investigation to find its origin.</p>
