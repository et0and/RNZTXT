            <p>Auckland police are investigating claims a man was assaulted outside the Destiny Church in the Auckland suburb of Wiri - a claim the church strongly denies.</p>
        
            <p>Police responded to a report of a fight between a man and two occupants of a property on Druces Road.</p>
        
            <p>It happened after the man was seen attaching a rainbow flag to the top of a nearby Norfolk pine tree.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement, a Destiny Church spokesman denied that a man had been assaulted.</p>
        
            <p>"This individual is just mischief-making, looking to make headlines to wind up the rainbow community and to make Destiny Church look bad.</p>
        
            <p>"Our security team noted that a prowler was on the church's private property, and the prowler proceeded to climb a tree to erect a flag. The police were called.</p>
        
            <p>"The local Manukau police attended, and they will confirm our story... The police said no action was necessary on their part."</p>
        
            <p>"Our security team and the police noted that the guy already had a black eye, so I sincerely hope he is not trying to accuse us of this, for the sake of a bit of drama to suit their case."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were making enquiries to find out what took place.</p>
        
            <p>They said no injuries were reported and an ambulance was not needed.</p>
