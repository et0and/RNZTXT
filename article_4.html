            <p>All Eastern Line services between Ōtāhuhu and Manukau have been cancelled this evening in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport says a track fault was the cause.</p>
        
            <p>Buses will accept train tickets to and from all stations affected.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier a KiwiRail track issue near Britomart meant all Western Line services were cancelled between Britomart and Newmarket.</p>
        
            <p>Minor delays were expected as the Western Line services returned to normal.</p>
