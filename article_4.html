            <p>Police are asking for help to identify a person in the search for missing Hutt Valley man Tom Basire.</p>
        
            <p>They said the 28-year-old was last seen in late November 2024 walking on the stop bank towards Petone, near the Ewen Bridge on Railway Avenue.</p>
        
            <p>He was wearing a red long-sleeved sweatshirt, black trousers and black sneakers.</p>
        
            <p>Detective senior sergeant Martin Todd said police were told Basire would occasionally visit an associate that lived in Petone.</p>
        
            <p>Todd said no other details of the person were known.</p>
        
            <p>He said police's search and rescue team searched the Hutt River last week but did not find anything of interest.</p>
        
            <p>However, Todd said footage taken during the search was still being analysed.</p>
        
            <p>If you have any information call 105 or update online using quoting reference number 241213/6143.</p>
