        <h2>Council debates $9m for New Plymouth zoo</h2>
        <p>
Councillor Gordon Brown wanted $9m earmarked for zoo compliance costs removed from the draft pan, which would effectively mean closing it down.

            <p>The future of New Plymouth's much-loved Brooklands Zoo came under scrutiny when councillors today debated the draft long-term plan for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>Just yesterday, council approved an ambitious seven-phase strategic vision for the boutique zoo, including new animal enclosures, a children's play area and a canopy walkway extending out into the native forest of Pukekura Park.</p>
        
            <p>But today, councillor Gordon Brown wanted $9 million earmarked for zoo compliance costs removed from the draft pan, which would effectively mean closing it down.</p>
        
            <p>He said the boutique zoo was now simply too expensive to maintain.</p>
        
            <p>"If you delve into it $1.5m is for three otters, I'm not sure how many of you have ever seen the otters, cuddled the otters or fed the otters if that's allowed. We are talking extraordinary amounts of money."</p>

            <p>He wanted businesses to step in.</p>
        
            <p>"Let private enterprise produce this and display those animals birds etc. The costs are getting way out of whack.</p>
        
            <p>"This is not an easy decision, but I'm asking you to look at $9m compliance, extra compliance and enhancements.</p>
        
            <p>"It's just got to the stage where we can't afford it anymore and we can put that money to much better uses."</p>
        
            <p>New Plymouth mayor Neil Holdom leapt to the defence of the zoo which as well as the otters was home to meerkats, squirrel monkeys, and capybara and included an aviary, playground and collection of farm animals.</p>
        
            <p>He reminded councillors when the public was consulted on the future of Pukekura Park, the zoo featured prominently.</p>
        
            <p>"The feedback was overwhelmingly reflecting the love of the zoo. The love of that space. A space that so many people go to so often," Holdom said.</p>

            <p>"I made the point yesterday, in a world of increasing costs, council's provision of services that are open access to all people actually reflects our egalitarian ideals.</p>
        
            <p>"If you think about the pressures on families. When the kids say they want to go bowling it's ka-ching, we want to go to the movies it's ka-ching, we want to go skating ka-ching, an escape room ka-ching.</p>
        
            <p>"Now those are awesome things to do, but when they say we want to go to the zoo, it's like, 'come on then let's go'."</p>
        
            <p>Holdom urged councillors to reject Brown's motion and instead embrace the strategic vision for the zoo.</p>
        
            <p>"Yes, you can say $9m for compliance, but let's look at it another way. We've got a zoo. the community loves it and it's getting old and tired.</p>
        
            <p>"We can give it a birthday to set it up for the next 30 or 40 years to set the standard. And yes, there's a capital cost to that, but that allows us to continue to evolve the park and make sure the facilities are fit for purpose."</p>
        
            <p>Brown's amendment was lost, but he was not without support around the council table.</p>
        
            <p>Deputy mayor David Bubblitz moved that council staff be instructed to investigate what the minimum viable compliance cost for the zoo would be.</p>
        
            <p>He could not resist a dad joke when speaking to his amendment.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't want the zoo to go, I don't think anyone wants the zoo to go, but I've got the costs here ... $1.5m for a habitat for three otters. That's $400,000 an otter. That's a whole 'otter' money.</p>
        
            <p>"That's a really, really, really nice five-bedroom house and I can't for the life of me get past that.</p>
        
            <p>"There's $2.9 million for the squirrel monkey cage. That's $3 million for the monkeys. Now I want them to be happy and I don't want to look down on them.</p>
        
            <p>"I want to make sure we are eye to eye. I want all of that kind of stuff, but I can't for the life of me understand why it costs so much."</p>
        
            <p>Bubblitz amendment was adopted.</p>
        
            <p>Council will meet to adopt a draft consultation document to go out for public consultation in February.</p>
        
            <p>In March public feedback will be sought before the 10-Year Plan 2024-2034 is adopted by council in June.</p>
