            <p>The lawyer of Dean Wickliffe, who is on hunger strike after he says he was beaten by guards at Spring Hill Prison, is calling for his immediate release citing health and human rights concerns.</p>
        
            <p>The 77-year old was taken into custody on 5 March after being found in living in his car, a breach of his parole conditions, after being made homeless.</p>
        
            <p>Wickliffe has spent a life in and out of prison, starting in 1972 for the murder of a Wellington jeweller during an armed robbery and a list of other offences, including drug and firearms offences, over many years.</p>

            <p>His lawyer Annette Sykes told RNZ Wickliffe had paid for his crimes and should be treated with dignity.</p>
        
            <p>"The fact that he was found with two stray cats that he'd been looking after in this car shows that this man isn't somebody who is selfish. He's actually worried about the least, perhaps, looked after in our society - the poor and the neglected. He has tried to do that himself, in his own way."</p>
        
            <p>Wickliffe has been on hunger strike since 10 March and Sykes said he was becoming increasingly distressed and his health had deteriorated.</p>
        
            <p>"Between the time he was transferred from the Tauranga Police cells [to Sping Hill] there's been a chain of events that have resulted in my client being bashed into a concrete floor, receiving significant injuries has received medical care as a result of the injuries that were inflicted upon him and has exacerbated his existing medical conditions. "</p>
        
            <p>He has a heart condition and was on blood thinners as a result of a heart disease that he was suffering from, Sykes said.</p>
        
            <p>Sykes also claims her client had lost 17 kgs since his hunger strike began and that an independent medical officer was worried about the affect of the hunger strike on his organs.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an extraordinary situation. He's a kaumātua. He's been violently abused and there haven't been steps taken to ensure that he is given properly legal advice as he's entitled.</p>
        
            <p>"Going on a hunger strike when you're in your 40s is quite different to going on hunger strike in your 70s. He's done that to draw attention to injustice, and we should do everything we can to ensure that that injustice is resolved." Sykes said.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Commissioner Custodial Services Kym Grierson confirmed to RNZ on Tuesday an investigation was under way into the alleged incident.</p>
        
            <p>Grierson said in a statement Wickliffe was drinking liquids but declining to eat food.</p>
        
            <p>"Our health and custodial staff are working together to support him and encourage him to resume eating. His health is being monitored by staff, including registered nurses and the prison doctor, and he is being offered a range of wellbeing and support services, including contact with local kaumatua."</p>
        
            <p>Sykes, a long-time practicing solicitor, said Wickliffe's case was "not an everyday occurrence".</p>
        
            <p>"This is an extreme situation, and we should be taking proper measures to protect the dignity and human life obligations to this individual and no matter who he is."</p>
        
            <p>"From a tīkanga Māori perspective, we as Te Arawa would be caring for our kaumatua in a much more dignified and honourable way than what seems to be happening at the moment."</p>
        
            <p>Sykes said since the news of Wickliffe's hunger strike broke there had been a flood of support from mana whenua Tainui, politicians, prisoner advocacy groups and people on social media.</p>
        
            <p>"This is a matter that is singing out for a resolution, taking into account his age and the circumstances of the alleged misfeasance that he's facing, but more fundamentally asking for us to look at human rights violations and how we stop them from continuing."</p>
        
            <p>"We will fight for his freedom, his freedoms we're fighting for." Sykes said.</p>
