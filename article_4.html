            <p>Fire investigators are still working to establish the cause of a blaze that scorched almost 180 hectares in the Far North.</p>
        
            <p>The blaze broke out on Saturday morning in the gumfields between Ahipara and Herekino, just south of Ninety Mile Beach.</p>
        
            <p>Incident controller Rory Renwick said he was hopeful firefighters would be able to pack up today, after a three-day effort, and hand the site back to the landowners.</p>
        
            <p>Four helicopters with monsoon buckets were deployed on Saturday to bring the blaze under control and stop it spreading into a nearby pine forest.</p>
        
            <p>That was reduced to two choppers and ground crews on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>A drone flown over the fire ground on Sunday night did not detect any remaining hotspots, Renwick said.</p>
        
            <p>A foot patrol was checking the site this afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>Renwick said the problem was the consistent 30-35km/h north-to-northwest winds.</p>
        
            <p>No property was damaged but it was only the combined effect of the helicopters and a valley with a change of vegetation that stopped the flames reaching a pine forest.</p>
        
            <p>"It's common for people to get complacent when we're not having a drought. But with scrub, the reality is, all you need is a few hours of sun and a good wind behind it, and you can get a really rapid spread."</p>
        
            <p>The fire was in mƒÅnuka and fern on private land.</p>
        
            <p>Renwick said the gumfields vegetation was "fairly uncommon" and often contained threatened plants.</p>
        
            <p>He could not comment on the cause while the investigation was still underway.</p>
