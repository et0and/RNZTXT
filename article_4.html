            <p>Significant winds have seen an out-of-control forest fire near Canterbury's Waipara jump to 85 hectares in size.</p>
        
            <p>The fire has been burning since Thursday and it was hoped that Fire and Emergency would be able to get it put out by the weekend.</p>
        
            <p>But strong winds saw the fire break its containment line on Sunday and it moved from 40ha in size to 85.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ Incident Commander Des Irving told Morning Report the fire was currently burning in trees and ember travelling was creating spot fires.</p>
        
            <p>Ground crews, helicopters, a drone team and heavy machinery was all being used in the response.</p>

            <p>"This will be a long duration event and we expect to be here for most of the week," Irving said.</p>
        
            <p>Irving said crews had experienced "significant wind issues" on Monday morning and more was expected.</p>
        
            <p>There was currently an orange level strong wind warning in place by MetService for Canterbury High Country, the Canterbury coast and Plains south of Ashburton, as well as North Otago.</p>
        
            <p>On Sunday, 30 kilometre winds and strong gusts had seen embers travel and create spot fires - with ash travelling as far as 2.5km south of the fire.</p>

The blaze began on Thursday.

            <p>Because of this, Irving said FENZ was doing assurance patrols.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 1 and 7 were close to the fire, he said, and people in the area were urged to be cautious.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone in nearby homes was told to call 111 if they had any concerns and be ready to go if needed.</p>
        
            <p>In Canterbury, Irving said FENZ was asking that people do not light fires at all at this time.</p>
        
            <p>A fire investigator had been at the scene at the weekend and the investigation into how it started was in its early stages.</p>
