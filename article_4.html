            <p>Auckland Business Chamber chief executive Simon Bridges is in hospital after an electric scooter accident today left him with a broken wrist and badly grazed face.</p>
        
            <p>The former National Party leader took to Instagram on Wednesday night to share news of the accident to his 10,000 followers.</p>
        
            <p>"This afternoon I hit a bump while I was on an electric scooter."</p>
        
            <p>Bridges, a former transport minister, said he had broken his wrist and hurt his face.</p>
        
            <p>The image shared to social media by Bridges shows significant grazes above and below his left eye as well as a cast on his arm.</p>
        
            <p>Bridges said he was "hugely grateful" to a family who stopped to help him and waited with him for an ambulance.</p>
        
            <p>"I don't know who they are, but they were incredibly kind to me," he said.</p>
        
            <p>He said staff at Auckland City Hospital had also been brilliant.</p>
        
            <p>Social media comments have poured in wishing for a speedy recovery for Bridges.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Transport Agency Waka Kotahi had until 30 September last year to decide whether to renew e-scooters' exemption from being classed as motor vehicles - a decision the agency earlier said would ban e-scooters from everywhere bar private property, given there is no mechanism for licensing riders.</p>
        
            <p>In 2018, shortly before Lime launched in New Zealand, NZTA declared that e-scooters were not motor vehicles under the Land Transport Act 1998 - but it was an exemption that would time out on 30 September, 2023.</p>
        
            <p>The exemption was renewed for another five years on 28 September.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, as Waka Kotahi announced consultation, the agency explained:</p>
        
            <p>"If Waka Kotahi does not renew the declaration, e-scooters would need to be registered and e-scooter riders would need to be licensed.</p>
        
            <p>"However, because there is currently no way of licensing them, it means that e-scooters could only be used on private property and in areas that are not legally considered roads (e.g. skateparks)."</p>
        
            <p>Consultation closed on 7 August.</p>
        
            <p>Waka Kotahi said it would consider "survey feedback as well as how renewing or not renewing the e-scooter declaration would contribute to an effective, efficient and safe land transport system".</p>
