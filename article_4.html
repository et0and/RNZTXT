            <p>State Highway 2 north of Wellington has reopened after earlier flooding.</p>
        
            <p>The left southbound lane was blocked before 7am on Friday near the Petone overbridge.</p>
        
            <p>Rush-hour traffic was being directed into the right-hand lane but both lanes opened after 9am, after the flooding receded.</p>
        
            <p>However, the NZ Transport Agency warned drivers to expect on-going delays until queued traffic clears.</p>
        
            <p>FINAL UPDATE 9:25AMSurface flooding has receded and all lanes are now OPEN. Please continue to expect delays while congestion eases. ^AP https://t.co/83NRIjdEe9</p>
        
            <p>The flooding came amid a wet day for much of the country.</p>
        
            <p>Heavy rain warnings and watches were in place for parts of Westland, Tasman, Tararua, Canterbury Lakes, northern Taranaki and Bay of Plenty.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington was forecast to have periods of rain including "possibly heavy before dawn", according to MetService.</p>
        
            <p>While the rain would ease in the region on Friday afternoon, it was expected to return at night.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, sewage has been discharged into Wellington's waterways after heavy rain overnight.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said high rainfall within the catchment has led to higher inflows at its processing plants.</p>
        
            <p>Shortly before 3am on Friday, untreated sewage was discharged into the ocean at Tarakena Bay from the Moa Point Wastewater Treatment Plant.</p>
        
            <p>Then, at 6am, treated wastewater was released into the Waiwhetū Stream in Lower Hutt from the Seaview Plant.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Water said it was arranging coastal samplings and people should stay out of the water.</p>
