            <p>Auckland's passenger rail network will shut for two weeks over the summer for improvement and maintenance work.</p>
        
            <p>The closure will run from Boxing Day until 14 January, and is part of the annual network shutdown.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail is expecting 1800 people to be working on the tracks at 89 sites across the city.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail chief capital planning and asset development officer David Gordon said the Christmas-New Year break was the best opportunity to get stuck in to projects, when many people were not commuting.</p>
        
            <p>There will be additional work on the Western Line, which will be closed again from 19-21 January.</p>
