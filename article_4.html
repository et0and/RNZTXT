            <p>A homicide investigation into the death of a Waikato woman at the end of last year has led police to execute search warrants across Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>Turipapa Tukere, who was 42-years-old, died following a brawl in Ng훮ruaw훮hia on 27 December.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to Waipa Esplanade, near the intersection with Newton Street, after reports of people fighting about 1.30pm.</p>
        
            <p>Some time later, Turipapa was taken to the ambulance station on Jordan Street in a critical condition but she died before she could be airlifted to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Police have since launched a homicide investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Police say there are now several houses of interest in Christchurch.</p>
        
            <p>"Staff from the Waikato-based investigation team travelled to Christchurch where they were assisted by Canterbury Police, including the Armed Offenders Squad, in executing several search warrants, today," acting Detective Inspector Andrew Saunders said.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result of those warrants, police are now speaking with several people as we work to find answers to key questions, including who was involved and what occurred prior to Turipapa's death."</p>
        
            <p>Police are still wanting to hear from anyone with information that may help the investigation.</p>
