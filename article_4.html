            <p>The Council of Trade Unions (NZCTU) is hosting protests in main centres around the country against what they say is "the government's ongoing attacks on workers' rights".</p>
        
            <p>"This is the most anti-worker government that we've seen in decades, attacking our rights day after day and trying to divide us," it said.</p>
        
            <p>About 1000 people gathered at Auckland's Aotea Square on Wednesday, with more chanting as they marched through central Wellington on the way to Parliament.</p>
