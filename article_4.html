            <p>Police are yet to find the person involved in a fatal hit and run in Lower Hutt's Naenae last week.</p>
        
            <p>But Belmont and Wainuiomata have been identified as locations of interest as sightings of the dark grey Mazda 6 involved in the incident on 16 November are sought.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday, Detective Inspector Haley Ryan said police were confident they would identify the driver with the help of the public and as a result of the ongoing investigation.</p>
        
            <p>"Police have identified two areas of interest," Ryan said.</p>
        
            <p>"One being Belmont, where the vehicle was stolen between 1am and 3am, and Wainuiomata, where the vehicle was from 3am leading up to the incident at 5.46am.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone with CCTV footage or sightings of the dark grey Mazda 6 sedan in those areas at the above times is urged to contact police on 105, quoting file number 231116/3474."</p>

            <p>Last week, Ryan said the vehicle was being driven erratically and speeding for several hours around the Hutt Valley prior to the tragic incident and continued to do so after hitting the victim.</p>
        
            <p>"The driver of that vehicle will know they have hit a person, and in all likelihood they will be panicking right now," she said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"I urge the driver or any occupant of that vehicle to come forward and speak to us, as we want to understand the events that have led to this tragedy."</p>
        
            <p>Ryan said police would release the victim's name when it was possible to do so.</p>
