            <p>Investigations into an aggravated robbery in Taupō and two aggravated robberies in Matamata have led to five arrests.</p>
        
            <p>Four young people were arrested after a petrol station was robbed during Easter weekend, on Johnbrook Crescent in Taupō.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Ryan Yardley said a group entered the store with weapons about 5pm on Monday 1 April, and items were taken from the store, including cigarettes.</p>
        
            <p>A 14-year-old and a 15-year-old are scheduled to appear in Taupō District Court on Friday 5 April. A 15-year-old and a 17-year-old are due to appear in Taupō Youth Court on Thursday 11 April.</p>
        
            <p>All four have been charged with burglary and aggravated robbery in connection to the Taupō incident.</p>
        
            <p>Yardley said the investigation into the robbery was ongoing, and they had no ruled out more arrests.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information the incident was encouraged to contact police on 105, using the reference number 240331/6737, or they could provide information anonymously using the Crime Stoppers service on 0800 555 111.</p>
        
            <p>Waikato police said they arrested a 19-year-old man after aggravated robberies on two separate dates at one commercial premises in Matamata's Tower Road.</p>
        
            <p>On Tuesday 26 March and on Thursday 4 April, the man "threatened employees with a knife, and targeted tobacco, cigarettes, and cash", a police spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>After the second incident, the man tried to get away on a bicycle, which was found not far from the scene.</p>
        
            <p>A police dog team then tracked the scent to a nearby property. Police were then able to locate items that had been stolen and to arrest the man.</p>
        
            <p>He faces multiple charges, including aggravated robbery and burglary, in relation to the two Matamata robberies, and appeared in Hamilton District Court on Friday 5 April. He was remanded to appear on 22 April.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand how distressing incidents like these can be for victims and we hope arrests like this can provide reassurance to both the victims and the community," Waikato East Detective Sergeant Ben Norman said.</p>
