            <p>A convoy led by Destiny Church leader Brian Tamaki caused long delays on State Highway 1 as it made its way to the Auckland Domain Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Several hundred people gathered at the 'Make New Zealand Great Again' rally.</p>
        
            <p>The protest was led by about 100 people on motorcycles, with others waving flags from accompanying vehicles.</p>
        
            <p>The group says the flags are in opposition to "divisive" Māori sovereignty flags of the hīkoi making its way to Parliament.</p>
        
            <p>Some of the group were displaying US President-elect Donald Trump signs and a banner saying "This is NZ's Trump Train".</p>
        
            <p>A couple of tourists told RNZ they were confused why they convoy were supporting Trump if they wanted unity as they felt Trump's policies do not promote unity. They said they were shocked to stumble upon the rally while on a walk in the park.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, counter-protesters representing Māori sovereignty and the liberation of Palestine had erected banners on bridges along the route. Signs reading "end mass murder" and "stop the genocide" could be seen on the Market Road bridge.</p>

            <p>In a post on social media ahead of the event, Tamaki said the haka in Parliament made New Zealand the "mockery of the world".</p>
        
            <p>Te Pāti Māori's Hauraki Waikato MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke on Thursday tore up a copy of the Treaty Principles Bill and launched into a haka, inspiring other opposition MPs and members of the public gallery to join in. Video of the incident went viral online and made headlines around the world.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaki called it a "Māori meltdown", and in a video filmed from his house showed off a New Zealand flag affixed to the back of a motorcycle, saying all other flags should be "banned".</p>

            <p>The controversial Destiny Church leader is facing charges alongside his wife, Hannah Tamaki, and two others for attending outdoor protests during the Level 3 lockdown in October and November of 2021.</p>
        
            <p>In January 2022, Tamaki was arrested at his home in Auckland after allegedly breaching his bail conditions. He spent 10 days in jail before being released.</p>
        
            <p>Tamaki ran for Parliament in 2023, his Freedom NZ umbrella party receiving 0.33 percent of the vote, putting them 11th.</p>
