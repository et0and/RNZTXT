            <p>A woman has been flown to Waikato Hospital in a serious condition after a dog attack in Coromandel on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Health New Zealand Te Whatu Ora said the woman was now in a stable condition.</p>
        
            <p>Air Crew Officer for Westpac Rescue Helicopter Simon Thorpe attended the scene in Tairua and said the woman was attacked by up to four dogs.</p>
        
            <p>Hato Hone St John said it was notified of the attack at 7.49am and responded with an ambulance, a first response unit and a helicopter.</p>
        
            <p>RNZ has asked Thames Coromandel District Council whether any dogs have been impounded after the attack.</p>
        
            <p>Thames Coromandel District Council says its thoughts are with the Tairua woman attacked by dogs this morning, but it will not say more about what happened.</p>
        
            <p>A council spokesperson says it is investigating the dog attack but until the investigation is complete it will not comment on the incident.</p>
        
            <p>Last year, Elizabeth "Effie" Whittaker, who was 78, died after a dog attack in the backyard of her ÅŒtiria Road home in Northland.</p>
