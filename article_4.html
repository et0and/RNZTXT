            <p>Warning: This story details sexual offending and may be distressing.</p>
        
            <p>A mother who said prostitution was "natural for a girl's body" took $50 from a man in exchange for him to have sex with her 16-year-old daughter.</p>
        
            <p>Yesterday, that mother, a Wellington woman in her 40s, was sentenced in the Wellington District Court to 15 months of intensive supervision for the criminal act.</p>
        
            <p>In November 2021, the woman, who has name suppression, asked her daughter if she would have sex with a man.</p>
        
            <p>She encouraged and persuaded the teenager to do it, according to the summary of facts.</p>
        
            <p>"You shouldn't be scared off [sic] this, this is natural for a girl's body. Just do it, I love you," the mother told her.</p>
        
            <p>The teen then went to a Newtown property and had sex with the man as her mother waited outside.</p>
        
            <p>She was paid $50 by the man, which she later handed to her mother.</p>
        
            <p>Police charged the woman with receiving earnings from a person under 18 - a charge contained in the Prostitution Reform Act. A second charge, of dealing in a person under 18, was withdrawn.</p>
        
            <p>At the sentencing hearing, Judge Ian Mill said a report outlined the mother's difficult upbringing.</p>
        
            <p>"You could've been [your daughter] in a way, as a younger person. I have a cultural report which makes for very sad reading," he said while adding it should not be taken as a justification for the crime.</p>
        
            <p>"Intensive supervision is recommended, it's not a case where you should go to prison or have a punitive sentence."</p>
        
            <p>He said he hoped the woman and her daughter could repair their relationship.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Mill sentenced the woman to 15 months of intensive supervision, an outcome supported by the woman's lawyer and the Crown.</p>
        
            <p>An application to suppress her name was also agreed.</p>
