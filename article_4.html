        <h2>'Buckets of happiness': Dream garden becomes labour of love</h2>

Ask dahlia devotee Vanessa Robinson to pick her favourite and you might be surprised to hear her say 'Pooh'.

            <p>Ask Canterbury dahlia devotee Vanessa Robinson to pick her favourite and you might be surprised to hear her say 'Pooh'.</p>
        
            <p>Happily, her choice is not as unappealing as it sounds, rather a pretty and playful Winnie-the-Pooh-inspired collarette, admired for its bright red-orange petals and yellow ruffle.</p>

            <p>Robinson said 'Pooh' resembled a burst of sunshine, bringing a smile to everyone's face.</p>
        
            <p>"It's such a conversation starter, because everyone asks, 'What's your favourite dahlia?' and I say, 'You wouldn't believe it, but it's named 'Pooh'."</p>
        
            <p>'Pooh' was among more than 800 dahlias on show in a joyous riot of colour at Robinson's Bloom Flower Farm, near Rolleston.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson started growing dahlias five years ago, branched out to a few hundred last year, then decided to annex the paddock to open a pick-your-own patch.</p>

            <p>"My husband looked at me like I was crazy, but it was a labour of love," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Months later, after countless hours laying weed mat and lanes, Robinson's bare paddock was transformed into the dahlia field of her dreams.</p>
        
            <p>Like a floral fashion show runway, top looks stemmed from the pure white elegance of 'Snowbound', radiant 'Sunny Boy' and the blush-pink petals of 'Coralie'.</p>

            <p>Robinson avoided colour blocking to give the dahlia field a box of chocolates-style flavour, "like a magical garden buffet serving a little something special for everyone".</p>
        
            <p>She ran regular pick-your-own sessions for dahlia lovers that were also popular with bridal, engagement and birthday parties.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson delighted in children picking favourites and families leaving with "buckets of happiness".</p>
        
            <p>"I have heard laughter from start to finish. I have old-fashioned music playing in the background, people are jiving and singing along to it," she said. "Everyone says they leave happy."</p>

            <p>Dahlias were still enjoying their moment in the sun, as Instagram stars with enduring retro charm, Robinson said.</p>
        
            <p>"Dahlias reminded me of my Nan. It was a walk down memory lane for me, whether it be a colour, the name of a flower - it was just something I really wanted to do for other people.</p>
        
            <p>"They just bring joy and happiness. I don't think there is any other flower that would beat a dahlia."</p>

            <p>Dahlias bloomed from mid-summer, until the first frost, providing long-lasting garden colour with little maintenance.</p>
        
            <p>Robinson's flower farm featured more than 100 different varieties, none of which were sprayed. Cut flowers lasted about a week in a vase.</p>
        
            <p>She would soon lift all 800 tubers, so they did not rot, and store them over winter, before devising next season's plans, including a further 200-400 plants, and a wedding lane of whites, pinks and apricots.</p>
        
            <p>For now, Robinson was simply enjoying a dream garden that had blossomed into reality.</p>
        
            <p>"I dreamed it, I've achieved it, I'm proud of it and I believe that anyone can do it, if they put their mind to it," she said.</p>
