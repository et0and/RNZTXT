        <p>
The Tairāwhiti Environment Centre is empowering the local community to minimise waste and learn about biodiversity.

            <p>The Tairāwhiti Environment Centre's recycling station sits just inside the door on the left-hand side. E-waste, batteries, soft plastic - the community knows it as a collection point for those goods that can't be recycled kerbside.</p>
        
            <p>Waste minimisation is one of their three pillars, or pou, says hub coordinator Steph Temple, with education a closely related second pillar.</p>
        
            <p>With about 500 visitors per month to the hub, and several local environment projects supported by the centre, it can be a busy spot.</p>

            <p>With a large meeting space for school and community groups, a sizeable food-growing garden complete with a workshop and beehives, and a trap library where people can pay a refundable deposit to 'check out' a predator trap for their garden, the centre aims to support the local community in efforts to help the environment.</p>
        
            <p>It's part of a network of 22 environment centres across Aotearoa, supported by Environment Hubs Aotearoa.</p>
        
            <p>In addition to drop-in services, the centre also supports local community environment projects by acting as an 'umbrella' organisation - providing help with the admin side of applying for and accepting funding, employing people, and getting a project off the ground.</p>

            <p>They also work closely with their neighbours in a garage next door, who share their waste minimisation ethos.</p>
        
            <p>"Since 2018 we've had over 300 tonnes of rescue food processed through here," says Gizzy Kai Rescue manager Lauren Beatty.</p>
        
            <p>The not-for-profit acts as the connecting link between food growers, producers and vendors, and local community groups who redistribute rescued food to those who need it.</p>
        
            <p>And, Lauren says, they are powered by volunteers that come from all parts of the community and range from 14 to about 85 years old.</p>
        
            <p>"We have 50 volunteers plus six board of trustees that are also volunteers. So, we average around 100 to 130 voluntary hours per month."</p>

            <p>She hopes they will continue to be able to respond to community needs and continue to minimise food waste in the region. They will also collaborate with Tairāwhiti Environment Centre to run the Every Bite programme to educate people about food waste.</p>
        
            <p>For Tairāwhiti Environment Centre, looking to the future is a little tough right now. It - and the other environment centres around New Zealand - have been supported by Ministry for the Environment funding since 2000 via Environment Hubs Aotearoa (EHA). But that will come to an end with the discontinuation of the Community Environment Fund.</p>
        
            <p>A Ministry for the Environment spokesperson said: "The ministry is working with EHA to manage the impact of this funding ending and support with this transition. There are no current plans to provide funding to EHA after June this year."</p>

            <p>But Steph remains positive. "Even though funds might soar or drop, it actually makes no difference. Everyone is doing amazing work and if money does fall short, then we just become more creative and we have to find the resilience within our community to come up with an idea to keep these doors open."</p>
