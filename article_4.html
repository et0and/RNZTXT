        <h2>Libraries cut hours as councils face double-digit rates hikes</h2>
        <p>
Councils are facing "extreme financial pressure" - but it means communities miss out, advocate says.

            <p>Public libraries are being sacrificed as councils across the country try to keep a lid on double-digit rates hikes.</p>
        
            <p>Horowhenua District Council confirmed on Friday it was reducing the hours of its cultural community centres and libraries.</p>
        
            <p>Among those was Shannon Library, which from 1 July would only be open from 1pm to 5pm on weekdays, and the first Saturday of each month.</p>
        
            <p>Te Takeretanga o Kura-hau-p≈ç Levin Library would close on Sundays, except for the library's youth space which would open from 1pm-4pm.</p>
        
            <p>"By making these adjustments, we're able to reduce the impact on rates for our community while striking a balance between serving our residents and easing the financial pressure many households are experiencing in the current economic climate," mayor Bernie Wanden said.</p>
        
            <p>While Horowhenua District Council was the latest to announce changes, it was not the only one.</p>
        
            <p>In 2023, South Wairarapa District Council cut hours at its three libraries due to changes in the Annual Plan.</p>
        
            <p>"We are doing the best we can to keep all our libraries open within current constraints," interim chief executive Paul Gardner said at the time.</p>
        
            <p>Featherston Library is now open on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, while Martinborough and Greytown's libraries are now open on just three weekdays and every second Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Cuts were being made to libraries across the country, Public Libraries New Zealand executive director Bernie Hawke said.</p>
        
            <p>"As a result of, in many cases, double-digit rate increases being considered by councils, lots of services provided by the councils are under duress," he said.</p>
        
            <p>That meant library hours and staff were being reduced, and some councils were considering closing branches.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke said he understood councils were facing "extreme financial pressure", but it meant communities would miss out, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"What that will translate to is less access to collections, less access to internet and technology, less access to public programmes, and with libraries being one of the most heavily used community services offered by councils, we're deeply concerned about these impacts."</p>
        
            <p>The association had submitted on a number of council long-term plans advocating against cuts to libraries, Hawke said.</p>
        
            <p>But it was councils' prerogative to make those changes, and Public Libraries New Zealand would be supporting managers and staff through "particularly difficult circumstances", he said.</p>
