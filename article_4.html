            <p>A Northland woman known as "the Tooth Fairy" has been fined $7000 and ordered to pay reparations of just over $3000 for working as a dental technician without being qualified.</p>
        
            <p>Claire Wihongi-Matene made and fitted dentures for Work and Income (WINZ) clients and the elderly from her home at Tautoro, south of Kaikohe.</p>
        
            <p>Her service was shut down in 2019, and after a years-long legal process she was sentenced in the Kaikohe District Court on Monday on seven charges laid by the Ministry of Health.</p>
        
            <p>The court heard some customers were never able to use their dentures and one woman had to be saved by her mokopuna after choking while a mould was being made.</p>
        
            <p>However, Wihongi-Matene also enjoyed strong support from the Kaikohe community.</p>
        
            <p>That was evidenced by the group of about 40 people who mounted a vocal protest outside the courthouse, holding placards with messages such as "Claire is not guilty" and "Tautoko Anahera Niho" (Support the Tooth Fairy).</p>
        
            <p>At least a dozen people were refused entry to the courtroom because there wasn't room for everyone who wanted to attend the sentencing, and police stationed extra staff outside in case tempers flared.</p>

            <p>The case has again highlighted the lack of dental services in towns such as Kaikohe, which has no dentist and no one capable of making dentures, despite being a service town for a large area with high health needs.</p>
        
            <p>Through an interpreter, kaumātua Tohe Ashby told the court Wihongi-Matene was obliged by tikanga (customs), and the instructions of her elders, to help her community.</p>
        
            <p>If someone asked her to repair their dentures she could not refuse, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"There are two laws inside of us. There is your law, and there is our Māori law."</p>
        
            <p>Community leader Danny Watson said the Ministry of Health had created a void, through the lack of dental services, that the community itself had filled.</p>
        
            <p>"She has provided a service that has changed lives, and that has been stopped by the ministry."</p>

            <p>Watson questioned why officials had not offered to support Wihongi-Matene so she could continue the work she was permitted to do, instead of pursuing a costly court case.</p>
        
            <p>However, an illustration of treatment that went wrong came from Elwyn Jones, husband of the late Kararaina Jones.</p>
        
            <p>He read a victim impact statement detailing how his wife had choked while a mould was being made and was never able to use her ill-fitting dentures.</p>
        
            <p>Instead, her meals had to be put through a food processor and she struggled to eat enough.</p>
        
            <p>"It destroyed and changed her," Jones said.</p>
        
            <p>His wife had to repay a WINZ loan of $1100 for the dentures even though she never used them.</p>
        
            <p>Prosecutor Geraldine Kelly called for fines totalling $23,000, saying Wihongi-Matene's offending was deliberate and premeditated.</p>
        
            <p>She had put patients at serious risk and her home set-up was inadequate and unsanitary, Kelly said.</p>
        
            <p>Over almost three years she had received $168,000 from Work and Income for clients' denture work, plus $15,000 from private customers.</p>
        
            <p>"I accept she felt an obligation to her people, but she was also motivated by financial gain," Kelly said.</p>
        
            <p>Defence lawyer Roslyn Park called for a discharge without conviction or, at worst, a conviction with reparation only and no fines, given Wihongi-Matene's financial situation.</p>
        
            <p>"She acted within tikanga, the obligation to help others. Some clients describe the work she did as life-changing."</p>
        
            <p>Judge Deidre Orchard, however, questioned the appeal to tikanga.</p>
        
            <p>"Surely even tikanga must direct that what you do for those who come to you for help must actually help them and not put them at risk," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Judge Orchard said she accepted dental care was difficult for the poor, or even those on modest incomes, to afford.</p>
        
            <p>"I also accept there are clearly a lot of people in the community who feel they have been helped by you, but there are others whose experience was not good."</p>
        
            <p>Judge Orchard imposed a fine of $1000 for each of the seven charges, plus reparations totalling $3050 for three patients and court costs.</p>
        
            <p>The fines would have been higher had it not been for Wihongi-Matene's financial circumstances, she said.</p>

</p>
        
            <p>Outside court, Wihongi-Matene said she was relieved a stressful time had come to an end.</p>
        
            <p>The experience would not change her determination to help her people, though she was not sure she wanted to continue with dentures.</p>
        
            <p>She was grateful for the outpouring of support from the Kaikohe community.</p>
        
            <p>"On paper I'm really broke - and right now I'm even more broke - but I actually think I'm a really wealthy wahine because of the support and growth over the past five years," Wihongi-Matene said.</p>
        
            <p>"When it first happened and I was first raided, I was really scared, but then my people came and they lifted me up and helped carry me through. I have such gratitude for all the people who have supported me over the past five years."</p>
        
            <p>Wihongi-Matene said she would "absolutely" like to get qualified, if it was possible.</p>
        
            <p>"I'd love to if I could afford it, and if I can make it work with my family."</p>
        
            <p>Now Kaikohe was back to having no denture service and it still had no dentist.</p>
        
            <p>All the town had was a pain clinic which would pull out teeth for people with a Community Services Card, she said.</p>
