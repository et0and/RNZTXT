            <p>Fire and Emergency is banning fireworks and sky lanterns in parts of Hawke's Bay and the Queenstown Lakes area from Friday due to high fire risk.</p>
        
            <p>The Hawke's Bay ban starts at 8am, and will continue to the end of March.</p>
        
            <p>Hawke's Bay District Manager Glen Varcoe said Ahuriri-Heretaunga, Wairoa Coast, Tukituki East and West, the southern Hawke's Bay coast, and Pōrangahau were all included.</p>
        
            <p>In all but Pōrangahau, open-air fires were already banned.</p>
        
            <p>Varcoe said it would not come as a surprise, as residents would be aware of the high fire risk around the region.</p>
        
            <p>In past years, fireworks have started major fires in hill country and on the coast.</p>
        
            <p>In late September, three men were arrested after they shot fireworks out of their vehicle window and started large vegetation fires in Hawke's Bay.</p>
        
            <p>Another major blaze in Hawke's Bay earlier in April started as a controlled gorse burning and got out of control.</p>
        
            <p>Recent rain in the region was not enough to counter the otherwise dry conditions.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency has also banned fireworks in the Queenstown Lakes area until further notice.</p>
        
            <p>It had also restricted open-air fires in the Strath Taieri and Coastal Waitaki - meaning anyone who wants to light one needed a permit.</p>
        
            <p>The restrictions did not change the year-round prohibited fire season in the special risk zones including Ruby Island, Queenstown and Mount Iron.</p>
        
            <p>There were also bans implemented in Central Otago, Naseby and upper Waitaki.</p>
        
            <p>Otago district manager Phil Marsh said in spite of recent rain and forecast rainfall, the district would continue to dry out, resulting in grasses that can easily ignite.</p>
        
            <p>"Fireworks are well known to start fires, especially in areas like Otago where we have mostly grassland valleys, scrubby hillsides and exotic forests.</p>
        
            <p>"Some recent fires in Central Otago and Waitaki became more serious because of high winds - for example old burn piles reigniting, and fires spreading to surrounding vegetation. The wind makes them hard to contain, and it takes longer to make sure they're really out."</p>
        
            <p>Marsh said if anyone planned to light a fire, they should go to checkitsalright.nz first and follow the guidance.</p>
