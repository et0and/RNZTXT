            <p>The identity of the man accused of stealing critical medical supplies from a rescue helicopter will remain secret for now.</p>
        
            <p>The Queenstown rescue helicopter was burgled at the Taieri Airfield in January after taking a critically ill patient to Dunedin Hospital early on Sunday, January 12.</p>
        
            <p>The 31-year-old was arrested three days later.</p>
        
            <p>He appeared before Judge David Robinson via video link in the Dunedin District Court today, facing three charges of burglary, two charges of unlawfully taking a motor vehicle and one charge of resisting police.</p>
        
            <p>Court documents at his last appearance showed the man was accused of burglary at the Taieri Airport yard, Cash Converters, Dunedin's Torpedo 7, Off The Chain, 2 Degrees, and another Dunedin address between 1 January and 12 January.</p>
        
            <p>He was accused of stealing items worth $809 from Rebel Sports Dunedin, taking a Queenstown Cleaners Ltd van, and taking a painting and decorator's van two days later.</p>
        
            <p>The man was also alleged to have taken a cleaning company's van on New Year's Eve.</p>
        
            <p>He was accused of resisting police and failing to supply identifying details on the day of his arrest.</p>
        
            <p>He has opted to represent himself after making a sovereign citizen speech during an earlier appearance.</p>
        
            <p>He was granted continued interim name suppression and remanded in custody until his next court appearance later this month.</p>
