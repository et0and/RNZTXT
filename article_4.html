            <p>A New Zealander has made it out of Gaza overnight, crossing into Egypt through the Rafah crossing.</p>
        
            <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said the person was being supported by the New Zealand Embassy in Cairo.</p>
        
            <p>Peters revealed via X (formerly Twitter) last week that five New Zealand permanent residents had escaped Gaza through the Rafah crossing. Last month, at least 11 New Zealanders and three permanent residents also made it out of Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>In early November, it was reported New Zealand ambassador to Israel Zoe Coulson-Sinclair was seeking approval from Israel to evacuate citizens, family members and New Zealand permanent residents from Gaza.</p>
        
            <p>MFAT said Israel and Egypt were in charge of decisions on who was able to cross the Rafah border.</p>
