            <p>Auckland's Mayor has made fun of the controversial Milford Beach stairs.</p>
        
            <p>In a statement to RNZ, Wayne Brown said he was unhappy Auckland Council spent over $263,000 to replace old concrete stairs at the popular North Shore beach.</p>
        
            <p>"I find this disgraceful.</p>
        
            <p>"It does not represent the 'better, faster, cheaper' message I have been trying to get council to adhere to since I've been mayor."</p>
        
            <p>The four sets of stairs connected a coastal walkway down to the beach.</p>
        
            <p>In an X post, Brown took a dig at the costly conundrum and shared a picture of himself at a construction site.</p>

            <p>Brown told RNZ he had made it clear Auckland Council projects needed to be properly costed and justified before getting the signoff.</p>
        
            <p>"This cannot happen again. I have instructed the CEO that we must work out how much we're prepared to spend on solving a problem before doing design work.</p>
        
            <p>"That way, we can ensure value for ratepayers' money."</p>
