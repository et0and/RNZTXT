            <p>An eight-year-old girl has been hospitalised after a dog attack at a Northland beach Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        
            <p>The far North District Council said in a statement on their website animal management officers were patrolling nearby at Taip훮 Beach when the girl was attacked while out with family.</p>
        
            <p>She was taken to Kait훮ia Hospital.</p>
        
            <p>The council said animal management patrols had been increased due to a previous dog attack.</p>
        
            <p>In that instance, a woman was attacked a few weeks ago by a couple of dogs on the same beach, a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Council said the dog involved in the attack on Wednesday had been impounded, and an investigation was underway to determine any consequences for it's owner.</p>
        
            <p>"The incident highlights the importance of owners ensuring their dogs are under control at all times, to protect members of the public," it said.</p>
        
            <p>"It does not appear there is a connection between the dog impounded for the attack yesterday afternoon and recently reported attacks at Taip훮."</p>
        
            <p>Police said they were not aware of the incident.</p>
        
            <p>"If it did occur, it hasn't been reported or notified to police," a spokesperson said.</p>
        
            <p>Locals have posted on social media.</p>
