            <p>High winds and large swells have cancelled a number of Cook Strait ferry sailings.</p>
        
            <p>The high winds in Picton and large swells in the Cook Strait are expected to last until Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Previously, the Marlborough Harbour Master had indicated no ferries would be allowed to berth in in Picton for a time as a result.</p>
        
            <p>Interislander has cancelled all of its Wednesday sailings of the Aratere and its Kaiarahi ferry is subject to delays.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, Bluebridge has cancelled most of its Wednesday sailings as well as some on Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>Further south, it's been a cold, snowy, windy day, with more yet to come.</p>
        
            <p>Metservice meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane told Morning Report driving could be hazardous with not only snow but fallen trees in some areas.</p>
        
            <p>"We've seen how the snow has impacted on snow travel and that does look set to continue for today," Makgabutlane said.</p>
        
            <p>"We are also keeping an eye on the winds on the West Coast, there have also been reports of roads and travel being impacted out that side from fallen trees and debris."</p>
        
            <p>Westport has recorded its strongest wind of the year with 105km/h, she said.</p>
        
            <p>"I think the main thing of note is that this wind direction is quite an unusual direction for them, hence why those impacts are more likely to be seen."</p>
        
            <p>Makgabutlane said most of the South Island would only reach single digit temperatures on Wednesday, with Central Otago heading for -5degC overnight and into Thursday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"At this point it does look to be reaching all the way across the South Island and then on Thursday parts of the North Island could also be on the chilly side."</p>
        
            <p>Cardrona Alpine Resort general manager Laura Hedley told Morning Report it stopped snowing on Tuesday afternoon after 60-40cm had fallen.</p>
        
            <p>"It was pretty good timing for us... we were due a snowfall, it means that we'll get through August really well.</p>
        
            <p>"We were definitely in the mood for a bit of snow and a bit of powder."</p>
        
            <p>Hedley said it was -9degC outside on Wednesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>"It's very very cold but I think most of the snow has come through now and we're looking forward to some sunny days coming up this week."</p>
        
            <p>Most of the orange weather warnings that were in place overnight Tuesday were lifted by Wednesday morning, although an orange heavy snow warning remained in place for the north Canterbury high country, there was also a yellow rain watch for eastern Marlborough.</p>
        
            <p>Road snowfall warnings were also in place for Lewis Pass and Porters Pass.</p>
        
            <p>Roads throughout the South Island have closed following the heavy snowfall.</p>
        
            <p>Snow has forced the closure of State Highway 8 between Twizel and Fairlie and State Highway 80 between Lake Pukaki and Mount Cook.</p>
        
            <p>In the lower south, State Highway 37 between Kyeburn and Palmerston has shut alongside State Highway 85 between Kyeburn and Outram.</p>
        
            <p>State Highway 73 Porters Pass between Springfield and Castle Hill remains open but with restrictions.</p>
        
            <p>The Transport Agency says no towing is permitted and chains are essential.</p>
