        <h2>New Kāeo Bridge set to open</h2>
        <p>
A long-awaited two-lane bridge will open in the Far North next week - but initially it will be only one way at a time, just like the old one.

            <p>A long-awaited two-lane bridge will open in the Far North next week - but initially it will take traffic in one direction at a time, just like the old one.</p>
        
            <p>The new Kāeo Bridge will partially open on the morning of Friday, 2 February.</p>
        
            <p>A spokeswoman for NZTA / Waka Kotahi said it would operate with traffic management and a one-way system while the new bridge was completed and the old one demolished.</p>
        
            <p>Work was also continuing on the road approaches to the new bridge.</p>
        
            <p>She urged motorists to take care while they adjusted to the changes and road crews were still working in the area.</p>
        
            <p>Work on the $40 million project, which includes a roundabout on the Kāeo side of the river to improve traffic flow, started in 2021.</p>
        
            <p>The new bridge is twice as long and wide as the old bridge, and also significantly higher to protect it from flooding.</p>
        
            <p>The old one-way Kāeo Bridge has long been a summer chokepoint on State Highway 10 between the Bay of Islands and Doubtless Bay. It was also too narrow for some loads.</p>
        
            <p>Replacing it was part of the 10 bridges pledge of the 2015 Northland by-election, in which then-Transport Minister Simon Bridges promised to upgrade 10 single-lane bridges on the region's Twin Coast Discovery Route.</p>
        
            <p>It is the fourth of the 10 bridges to be completed. The first two, on State Highway 12 at Matakohe, were completed in mid-2019.</p>
        
            <p>The 107-metre-long, two-lane Taipā Bridge, on State Highway 10 in Doubtless Bay, was opened in December 2019.</p>
