            <p>He was last seen wearing a black T-shirt, black Nike shorts and bare feet.</p>
        
            <p>"William is known to frequent the Counties Manukau area," police said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"Police are requesting anyone who sights him to contact police as soon as possible on 111."</p>
