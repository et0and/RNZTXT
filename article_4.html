            <p>The average cost of going to the dentist has risen by almost a quarter in the past few years.</p>
        
            <p>About half of New Zealanders are now avoiding seeing the dentist due to cost barriers, a national health survey has revealed.</p>
        
            <p>Figures from the New Zealand Dental Association show the price of a typical appointment - including an exam, clean, x-ray and composite fillings - has gone up $98 between 2020 and 2023.</p>
        
            <p>Association chief executive Mo Amso said it was no surprise there had been a sharp increase in the three years since the last survey was done.</p>
        
            <p>He said the figures were in line with inflation and covered the costs of products, staff and equipment.</p>
        
            <p>"With the inflation rates that we've had over the last three years or so, cumulatively it is actually on par.</p>
        
            <p>"It has taken sort of a similar path to a lot of other services and consumer goods that have equally gone up by inflation, some probably more than that."</p>
        
            <p>It was very concerning that half of New Zealanders were avoiding the dentist due to cost, he said, and the government needed to address the issue urgently.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a problem that's not going to go away and it does require leadership.</p>
        
            <p>"Unless there is a political will to change things, half of the people of New Zealand will continue to be unable to access dental care."</p>
        
            <p>Amso said people on low incomes were the most affected.</p>
        
            <p>"The working poor, as we call it, are unfortunately the most disadvantaged group of people.</p>
        
            <p>"They are just above the threshold for a benefit or any subsidy for dental care from government, but are struggling to afford basic dental care."</p>
        
            <p>More people needed to be made eligible for government dental subsidies, he said.</p>
        
            <p>The survey showed the average price for a dental examination was now $89, but that differed from area to area.</p>
        
            <p>North of Auckland, the average price was $75, but in Otago/Southland it ballooned to $125.</p>
        
            <p>Half an hour of tooth scaling set patients back $96 on average, while getting a single tooth extracted cost an average of $291.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a single amalgam (silver-coloured) filling cost between $201-323 on average, depending on the size of filling required, while a composite (tooth-coloured) filling cost between $231-$378.</p>
        
            <p>In the 2023 election, Labour campaigned on providing free dental care to people under 30, while National pledged $120 million in additional spending on the Child Dental Package over four years.</p>
