            <p>A Nelson swimming club said it's close to sinking, after the council hiked the price of hiring one pool lane to around $40 per hour.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson South Swim Club carries out its coaching for 12 weeks over winter at Riverside Pool.</p>
        
            <p>Over the past four years the cost of a lane, per hour, has crept from $27 to $40 - although the club gets a $2 discount on that.</p>
        
            <p>Nelson South Swim Club coach Glen Findlay compared the price of the almost 100-year-old facility to that of Christchurch's, which he described as a "state-of-the-art" new pool, which only charges $12.50.</p>
        
            <p>"It's a significant challenge for our families, and our swimmers. And even potentially for the programme's survival," he told Checkpoint.</p>
        
            <p>"We're probably one of the leading provincial swimming programmes in the country, we've got kids in there that are learning to swim right through to very good, competitive swimmers at a national level, and from all backgrounds and socio-economic situations.</p>
        
            <p>"(It's) very difficult to get people into the programme with those costs, and to retain them."</p>
        
            <p>Findlay said Nelson City Council had acknowledged the rate is high, but despite the club pleading the case for the rate to be dropped, it was then raised.</p>
        
            <p>The club are hoping for resolutions from the council in December, but in the meantime, are having to deal with people leaving the programme.</p>
        
            <p>As a coach, Findlay is disheartened to see swimmers depart and miss out on reaching milestones.</p>
        
            <p>"It's soul-destroying," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"When you've been involved in the industry and see the power of the sport, whether it's a child behind the swimming blocks for the first time at a race, or swimming a width for the first time.</p>
        
            <p>"It's incredibly powerful, and to know that people aren't going to be engaging in that is pretty tough."</p>
        
            <p>Findlay believes at half the price at $20 is still at the upper end of line hire rates around New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"We don't want special treatment, we don't want a super-duper deal, but we think we need a fair price and we think that would be a starting point," he said.</p>
