        <h2>Troubled ferry moved to a new berth, damage inspection to begin</h2>
        <p>
Aratere has been moved so it doesn't disrupt another ferry's operations. Meanwhile, it's forward tanks are being opened for investigation
</p>
        
            <p>The stricken interislander ferry Aratere has been shifted to a berth usually used by logging ships while investigations continue into its grounding on Friday night.</p>
        
            <p>The ship - with 39 crew and eight truck drivers on board - lost steering control just after leaving Picton.</p>
        
            <p>It had to be refloated on the high tide on Saturday night after which it was taken under tow to Picton.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail said Maritime New Zealand's detention order remained in place and the Aratere will not sail until it received clearance.</p>
        
            <p>However, executive general manager Duncan Roy said it has been moved to Waimahara Wharf to free up the main wharf so that Kaitaki was not disrupted as it continued moving passengers and freight across Cook Strait.</p>
        
            <p>"Today we are opening the Aratere's forward tanks so a detailed internal inspection for damage can be undertaken. Maritime NZ and TAIC continue to inspect the vessel and we are working with them as their investigations progress.</p>
        
            <p>"We cannot confirm how long this process will take."</p>

            <p>Kaiarahi remained in wet dock and remained on schedule to return to service on 6 July.</p>
        
            <p>Before this date Kaiarahi would go through a controlled, phased return to service which included manufacturer's approval on the work and sign off from an independent assessor.</p>
        
            <p>"Interislander also has its own approval process, which includes successful sea trials."</p>
        
            <p>Until the end of Friday, passengers booked on Aratere have now been shifted onto Kaitaki sailings.</p>
        
            <p>KiwiRail was still working on how it would handle affected freight this week, and was receiving support from Bluebridge.</p>
