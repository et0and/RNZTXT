            <p>TikTok is not doing enough to get rid of content that promotes disordered eating, says a young woman suffering from an eating disorder.</p>
        
            <p>Eating disorders have increased by a third in the past four years, and social media has been blamed for the rise.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this month, TikTok banned the hashtag 'legginglegs', which celebrated legs that were said to be thin enough to look good in tight-fitting leggings. The social media platform instead redirects users to the Eating Disorders Association.</p>
        
            <p>It's another in the long list of hashtags no longer allowed on the app, in a bid to make it a safer place, but that hasn't stopped 'Eating Disorder TikTok'.</p>
        
            <p>One young woman - who RNZ has agreed not to name - said content promoting eating disorders was hiding in plain sight, with new code words popping up every day.</p>
        
            <p>"It can be as simple as just replacing a letter with a number. For example, instead of ED for eating disorder, it would be 3D."</p>
        
            <p>And despite blocking certain people and hashtags, it had not gone away.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if you are actively in recovery, and you're trying your hardest to stay away from those triggering posts, social media will now feed that to you," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"The algorithm will make sure that you have to watch it, or you have to at least swipe past it."</p>
        
            <p>There has been a 34 percent increase in people diagnosed with eating disorders in the past four years. According to the Ministry of Health, 2085 people were diagnosed in 2023, up from 1556 in 2019.</p>
        
            <p>A mother who had quit her job to focus on her daughter's recovery said social media had played a huge role.</p>
        
            <p>"It's not just her looking up dieting or exercises, the algorithm finds her, and that's all that pops up," she said.</p>
        
            <p>Selina Elison said even if she banned her daughter from using social media, her friends would still discuss the content they had seen at school.</p>
        
            <p>She said they discussed the glamorisation of dieting and eating disorder behaviour that they had seen online.</p>
        
            <p>Elison published a book - Bulimia: Understanding the Voice Inside Her Head - this week, about her struggle to find adequate treatment for her daughter in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>She said there needed to be more funding, education, and support - not just for the person affected, but for their families too.</p>
        
            <p>"It gets tiring after a while, because you struggle.</p>
        
            <p>"All you think about is food, and if your child is eating, and when you have your child at home, you don't even know what to talk about anymore.</p>
        
            <p>"You're overwhelmed, and you're very fearful because your child can die," she said.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Eating Disorders Clinic provides specialist eating disorder treatment.</p>
        
            <p>Director Dr Roger Mysliwiec said the health system was outdated, and was unprepared for the growing number of people who needed help in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>"I would suggest a review of the whole eating disorder treatment provision," he said.</p>
        
            <p>The Eating Disorders Association of New Zealand provides support, help and resources to people caring for loved ones with an eating disorder.</p>
        
            <p>Megan Tombs, who runs the nonprofit organisation, said content from TikTok did not stay on the app.</p>
        
            <p>"Most of the young children have grown up with YouTube videos, and so parents are a lot more lenient, but the content on YouTube gets just as dark," she said.</p>
        
            <p>"Even if you keep your child off TikTok, the TikTok videos end up on Youtube and they watch it that way."</p>
        
            <p>Despite months-long waiting lists and difficulty in getting treatment, Tombs said sufferers and their families should not give up.</p>
        
            <p>"Recovery is one hundred per cent possible, one hundred per cent of the time."</p>
        
            <p>A statement on TikTok's website said it wanted to be a place that encouraged self-esteem, and did not promote negative social comparisons.</p>
        
            <p>They said they did not allow showing or promoting disordered eating or any dangerous weight loss behaviours.</p>
        
            <p>However, TikTok said that they were aware it continued.</p>
        
            <p>They stated that they have consulted eating disorders experts, researchers, and physicians to acknowledge more symptoms, such as as overexercise or short-term fasting, that are frequently under-recognised signs of a potential problem.</p>
        
            <p>"This is an incredibly nuanced area that's difficult to consistently get right," they said.</p>
