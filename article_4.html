            <p>Two men found seriously injured in a Manurewa street had gunshot wounds, police say, and they are appealing for witnesses to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>Police were called to Addington Avenue about 3.20am on New Year's Day, where the two men were found unresponsive in a car. The men were taken to hospital in a critical condition.</p>
        
            <p>Armed police had set up a cordon, and by Monday afternoon part of the street remained closed off as enquiries continued. But police had finished a scene examination, Detective Inspector Karen Bright said.</p>
        
            <p>"We believe that this was an isolated incident and there is not thought to be an ongoing risk to the community," Bright said.</p>
        
            <p>She asked that anyone who knows anything about what happened come forward.</p>
        
            <p>"Police encourage anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who has information that could assist with our enquiries, to contact police."</p>
        
            <p>A Manurewa resident said the neighbourhood was "in shock" after waking up to find their street had become a crime scene.</p>
        
            <p>Forensic specialists had been examining a green sedan that appeared to have crashed into a van parked on the street.</p>
        
            <p>Resident Charlton Leo said the area was normally very quiet.</p>
        
            <p>"This is quite unusual ... no one comes here, it's fairly quiet at night.</p>
        
            <p>"I think everyone's in shock, really."</p>

            <p>He had returned home last night after watching the fireworks in town and went to bed.</p>
        
            <p>"We saw some flashing lights around about 3am, we didn't think anything of it. We just thought maybe [it was] the police catching some drunk.</p>
        
            <p>"Then we woke up this morning to see everything outside, the street blocked ... we didn't really know anything."</p>
        
            <p>Leo said he did not notice anything out of the ordinary last night.</p>
        
            <p>"There were a few people lighting flares ... people just having fun. We didn't think anything of it, and went to bed."</p>
        
            <p>Police were asking people to avoid the area but said there was no immediate risk to public safety.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with information about the incident was asked to call police on 105, or to visit their Update Report page online at 105.police.govt.nz and quote file number 240101/2378. Information could also be provided anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, or on their website.</p>
