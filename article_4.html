            <p>Hundreds of homes in the North Island are still without power after this week's storm.</p>
        
            <p>In Auckland, the outages include Muriwai on the west coast, the Waitākere Ranges, Pūhoi to Warkworth, and southern suburbs including Māngere, Whitford and Papatoetoe.</p>
        
            <p>More than 200 properties in Counties Manukau and 180 homes in Coromandel, Waikato, New Plymouth and Palmerston North are without electricity.</p>
        
            <p>Power provider Wel Network said its outages were mainly in the Raglan and Te Uku areas.</p>
        
            <p>Crews were working through the night to reconnect as many as possible, but anyone not connected at the moment should prepare for a night without power, it said.</p>
        
            <p>Some parts of Auckland recorded gusts of up to 120km/h on Wednesday and early Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>It left large parts of Auckland without power - including Henderson Valley, Waitākere, Bethells Beach, Helensville, Parakai, Kumeū, Dairy Flat, Kaukapakapa, Waiheke, Whangaparāoa, and Ellerslie.</p>
        
            <p>Vector had said strong gales across the Auckland region had blown trees and vegetation onto lines that caused damage and network faults.</p>
