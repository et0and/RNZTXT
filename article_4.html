            <p>Northland Police are speaking with two people of interest as they investigate the unexplained death of a toddler in 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Police reignited their investigation into the death of 4-year-old girl Alestra Kepa-Hati this week, almost 9 years after she died.</p>
        
            <p>"We have a grieving whƒÅnau who need closure for the death of their loved one," Detective Senior Sergeant Christian Fouhy said in a statement.</p>
        
            <p>"We know there are people in our community who know what happened to Alestra."</p>
        
            <p>He said the historic investigation was steady making progress, with officers locating two people of interest as they gathered information about the circumstances leading to the child's death.</p>
        
            <p>Alestra Kepa-Hati was living with caregivers in rural Kaikohe when she died in October 2015.</p>
        
            <p>Police asked anyone who sighted Kepa-Hati or had any involvement with her or her two younger siblings to come forward.</p>
        
            <p>"Any piece of information - no matter how small, how old, or seemingly insignificant - could be the key piece of the puzzle we need to bring this case to a resolution," Fouhy said.</p>
