            <p>Tom Phillips and his three children have been missing for the last two and a half years.</p>
        
            <p>Ember, eight, Maverick, nine, and Jayda, 10, have been missing since December 2021, when they were taken by Phillips to an unknown location - though police believe it was in Western Waikato within Marokopa or the surrounding areas.</p>
        
            <p>Police on Tuesday announced an $80,000 reward for information on the family that led to their location and safe return. Since then a police helicopter has been searching through the Marokopa area as officers work through tip-offs they have received.</p>
