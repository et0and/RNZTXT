            <p>New food labelling standards designed to protect customers with severe allergies come into force on Sunday.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand Food Safety deputy director-general Vincent Arbuckle said they had worked with Food Standards Australia New Zealand to ensure all food packaged from here on was in plain English.</p>
        
            <p>Any potentially life-threatening common allergens must be in bold in the ingredients list, and manufacturers would also have to be more specific about the types of nuts present in their food.</p>
        
            <p>Some 8 percent of New Zealanders had a food allergy, and some of those were life-threatening, Arbuckle said.</p>
        
            <p>Side effects ranged from swelling, hives and vomiting to anaphylaxis.</p>
        
            <p>Food packaged before 25 February could still be sold without new labels for the next two years or until it expired.</p>
