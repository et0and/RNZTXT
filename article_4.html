            <p>Christchurch City Council has announced it is resigning from Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ).</p>
        
            <p>Councillors at a meeting today decided to longer be part of LGNZ, after its annual membership costs rose by more than $20,000 dollars.</p>
        
            <p>The decision came after a report was presented at the meeting about renewing the annual membership subscription for the association, which represents the interests of councils around the country. The annual cost for Christchurch is $163,254.75 plus GST for the 2024/2025 year.</p>
        
            <p>Councillors voted to put the unspent budget for this year towards elected member professional training, workplace support services and parliamentary engagement.</p>
        
            <p>The report to council said a number of the reasons for remaining a member were not readily quantifiable.</p>
        
            <p>In March 2023, Auckland Council voted to leave LGNZ after Mayor Wayne Brown used his casting vote when the votes were tied 10-all.</p>
