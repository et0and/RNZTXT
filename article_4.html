            <p>Fire and Emergency is urging the public to be cautious next week, with high and extreme fire danger expected for many areas in the country.</p>
        
            <p>This includes Central Otago, the Mackenzie Basin, South Canterbury's high country, Canterbury, Marlborough, Wairarapa, Northland and Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Wildfire Manager Tim Mitchell said a warm air mass from Australia was expected to pass over the country, bringing very warm temperatures and gusty winds in some places.</p>
        
            <p>"These conditions will drive up the fire risk, particularly on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, especially in those areas which are already dry and experiencing elevated fire danger.</p>
        
            <p>"Fires in these conditions will start quickly, spread quickly, and pose a threat to life and property."</p>
        
            <p>Many areas already have restricted or prohibited fire seasons in place.</p>
        
            <p>Activities such as mowing, operating machinery, cutting, or welding steel, if done in or near long dry grass, could be hazardous and should be carried out during cooler parts of the day, Mitchell said.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ urged people to visit www.checkitsalright.nz to check that it is safe before undertaking fire risk activities outdoors.</p>
