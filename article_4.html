            <p>Police have asked the public not to take the law into their own hands over reports of an attempted kidnapping in Porirua.</p>
        
            <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Peter Middlemiss said police were continuing their enquiries after it was reported a man attempted to get a woman into a black van earlier this week.</p>
        
            <p>But he said social media posts encouraging vigilante behaviour were "incredibly concerning".</p>
        
            <p>"We know reports like this can cause great alarm in the community, however police have received a call from an innocent person who was accosted by a member of the public, wrongly accusing him of being involved.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone attempting to take the law into their own hands could face charges, Middlemiss said.</p>
        
            <p>Despite extensive enquiries police had not been able to fully establish what occurred with the black van, he said.</p>
        
            <p>"We urge the community to bear in mind that not everything you read online is what it seems."</p>
