            <p>More unstable weather is on the way as 30000 lightning strikes hit the country on Thursday.</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist David Miller said a front of thunderstorms hit the west quite hard on Thursday, including Auckland.</p>

            <p>NIWA posted on social media saying 200,000 lightning strikes were recorded over the Tasman Sea as thunderstorms passed through.</p>
        
            <p>A lot of thunderstorm activity over western parts of the North Island, as an active front spreads onto the country. Keep safe out there. Check your forecast athttp://bit.ly/metservicenz pic.twitter.com/KsQylmH0cu</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile today, snow warnings have been issued for Milford Road and Lewis Pass in the South Island.</p>
        
            <p>MetService said another one to two centimetres of snow was expected to accumulate on the roads above 800 metres this morning.</p>
        
            <p>It said western areas on Friday may experience showers and strong winds persist in the lower North Island and lower South Island.</p>
        
            <p>"Elsewhere, brighter skies are expected, with Hawke's Bay likely to experience unseasonably warm temperatures."</p>
        
            <p>MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said with all the active weather around, it is best to make the most of any good weather when it comes.</p>

            <p>However on Saturday, another round of wet and windy weather is expected.</p>
        
            <p>"While most regions can expect windy conditions, the strongest gusts are likely over the lower, inland, and eastern parts of both main islands. A strong wind watch has been issued for the Canterbury High Country, and additional areas may be added as the system approaches," MetService said.</p>
        
            <p>"Heavy rain is expected in the west, from Fiordland up to Tasman, and even into Canterbury and Otago near the Southern Alps. Lesser rain amounts are forecast for other parts of the South Island."</p>
        
            <p>MetService said the rain would spread over the North Island from Saturday afternoon, with the evening and overnight hours looking particularly wet.</p>
        
            <p>"Regions such as Waikato, Taranaki, Horowhenua, and Kāpiti - including the Tararua Range - could see periods of heavy rain, extending to the eastern ranges of the Bay of Plenty on Sunday."</p>
