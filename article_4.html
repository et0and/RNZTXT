            <p>The tourism industry has launched its strategy to address underfunding, grow its workforce and become net carbon zero.</p>
        
            <p>The plan outlines its ambitions about the future of tourism in Aotearoa from now until 2050 with 10 key steps to achieve them, and was launched at Tourism Summit Aotearoa in Wellington on Tuesday morning.</p>
        
            <p>It includes plans to reset how tourism is managed and funded, embrace Māori culture and champion biodiversity.</p>
        
            <p>Tourism Industry Aotearoa chief executive Rebecca Ingram said this was a transformation plan that relied on businesses, government and industry to work together</p>
        
            <p>"Each tourism business, regardless of size, has a role to play including embracing Te Whakarae Māori, living the principles of Tiaki, and championing sustainability to work towards a net carbon zero future.</p>
        
            <p>"It's this collective commitment that makes a difference to all New Zealanders and will propel tourism forward."</p>
        
            <p>Ingram said it was about balanced growth.</p>
        
            <p>"New Zealand's tourism industry is considering how global and local forces will push and pull the industry. We must prepare for the future by leaning in, and this means having a great plan."</p>
        
            <p>The ten actions include creating a National Tourism Policy Statement to clearly define the structures, roles and responsibilities within the industry, addressing industry funding by investigating more sustainable funding options, using data, research and industry so it can make informed decisions, embracing Māori culture, improving how the Department of Conservation and the industry work together, and ensuring Tiaki is promoted and guides the industry.</p>
