            <p>A young woman who suffered an extremely rare, near-fatal reaction to a medicine says it was terrifying not knowing whether she would ever fully recover.</p>
        
            <p>Charlotte Gilmour, 23, spent a month in Palmerston North Hospital being treated for Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which only affects one or two people in a million each year globally.</p>
        
            <p>She had been battling a chest infection for a month when she woke up one morning with a strange rash and what she thought was conjunctivitis.</p>
        
            <p>"I looked in the mirror and I just burst into tears. I think I subconsciously knew it was something quite serious."</p>
        
            <p>Her GP immediately diagnosed her with Stevens-Johnson syndrome - an extremely rare allergic reaction to medication.</p>
        
            <p>The culprit in this case was lamotrigine, which Charlotte had been taking to treat depression.</p>
        
            <p>Once at Palmerston North Hospital, some Filipino nurses recognised Stevens-Johnson syndrome from cases in their home country, but no-one had much information on how to treat it because it was so rare.</p>
        
            <p>"It was scary, I guess, hearing... 'OK, no-one really knows a lot about this'."</p>
        
            <p>
Charlotte's skin developed massive blisters like she had been cooked. She needed a feeding tube because her mouth and oesophagus were burned.

            <p>Charlotte's skin developed massive blisters like she had been cooked. She needed a feeding tube because her mouth and oesophagus were burned.</p>
        
            <p>"The scariest part about it is that it burned me from the inside out.</p>
        
            <p>"So all the burns on the outside were because my insides were so burned that it started to manifest on the outside of my skin."</p>
        
            <p>Steroids made no difference initially.</p>
        
            <p>"So they stopped them, [saying] 'There's no point' and then it just got worse and worse until there was one night it got so bad I pretty much lost my vision.</p>
        
            <p>"I said, 'Please, can you just try some steroids again?', and that definitely helped in the end."</p>

            <p>After 30 days in hospital, she was discharged in November and has made a good recovery, despite a few setbacks.</p>
        
            <p>"I still get blisters pop up in my eyes and the rash flares up, always in the same place where the worst burn was."</p>

            <p>In the five years to the end of December, Medsafe received 710 reports of adverse reactions from lamotrigine, including six deaths.</p>
        
            <p>The Government's drug safety agency said about one in 1000 adults, treated with lamotrigine, would develop a serious rash which could - in very rare cases - progress to Stevens-Johnson syndrome.</p>
        
            <p>Those risks were higher in children taking lamotrigine for epilepsy.</p>
        
            <p>Medsafe acting group manager Derek Fitzgerald said the reporting of adverse reactions was "largely in proportion" with the level of use in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>More than 17,000 people were prescribed the drug last year for a range of conditions.</p>
        
            <p>"Effective medicines, which allow people with life-threatening conditions to live close to normal lives, can often also cause severe adverse reactions in some people," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"Rare, though potentially life-threatening, skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, linked with lamotrigine, are related to the medicine itself rather than the brand.</p>
        
            <p>"Anyone starting treatment with lamotrigine, or increasing their dose of the medicine, and who gets a rash should see their doctor right away."</p>
        
            <p>More than 200 medicines are known to cause Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.</p>
        
            <p>There were four other cases of Lamotrigine induced SJS in the past 5 years in New Zealand, according to Medsafe data.</p>
