            <p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment is probing problems with fuel on the Bluebridge Connemara ferry.</p>
        
            <p>Contaminated fuel caused the ferry to lose power and drift more than two hours in the Cook Strait in September, StraitNZ confirmed on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>The contaminated fuel damaged the ship's fuel injectors, which caused the power loss, chief executive Shane McMahon said.</p>
        
            <p>The injectors were fixed and the contamination cleared, but the company was still looking into how and where the fuel was contaminated.</p>
        
            <p>MBIE was also investigating, but the ministry itself had not confirmed the fuel was contaminated, its trading standards national manager Stephen O'Brien said.</p>
        
            <p>"This matter is currently still under investigation and the existence or source of any potential contamination has not been confirmed at this stage," he said.</p>
        
            <p>"This investigation will also include determining whether any potential contamination occurred on the vessel or in the supply chain."</p>
        
            <p>It had tested samples of fuel supplied to the vessel and had not identified any problems with the fuel as it was supplied, O'Brien said.</p>
        
            <p>"We have expanded our testing scope to include a number of historic fuel deliveries, and we expect these test results next week."</p>
        
            <p>StraitNZ told the ministry on Monday that fuel may have been a factor in the Connemara's power loss, he said.</p>
        
            <p>Resources Minister Shane Jones said he was not concerned about any widespread problems with fuel in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>His office told RNZ he would await the outcome of MBIE's investigation.</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, the union representing ship masters and officers said StraitNZ and Maritime NZ should have fronted up on the Connemara's problem immediately, in case it happened to any other vessel.</p>
        
            <p>Maritime operators needed to know how to prevent further issues, Merchant Service Guild's vice president Iain MacLeod said.</p>
        
            <p>But Maritime NZ said testing showed there were no problems with fuel supplied out of Wellington, and if there were, it would have notified appropriate people.</p>
        
            <p>Transport Minister Simeon Brown said he was satisfied with Maritime NZ's communication to him and the public.</p>
