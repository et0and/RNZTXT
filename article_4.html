            <p>A large fire at a factory in the Auckland suburb of Ōtāhuhu has now been contained.</p>
        
            <p>Firefighters were called to the building on McGee Street about 3.20pm on Friday and found it well ablaze.</p>
        
            <p>The fire then spread to an adjoining building, Fire and Emergency NZ incident controller James Hall said.</p>
        
            <p>Fifteen trucks and two support vehicles were battling the blaze at its peak.</p>
        
            <p>Hall said about 8pm that firefighters had contained the blaze in the second building and were working to fully extinguish it. They were also dampening down hotspots in the original building.</p>
        
            <p>Residents in the area were advised to keep their windows and doors closed.</p>
        
            <p>Motorists were asked to avoid the area and use any signposted diversions to allow emergency services access to reach the site.</p>
        
            <p>Train services were suspended between Middlemore and Ōtāhuhu because of the fire, which was very close to railway lines.</p>
        
            <p>Auckland Transport said about 8pm that the power had been turned back on at Ōtāhuhu Station, "which means our train services can now run all the way along the Southern and Eastern lines.</p>
        
            <p>"Because of the significant delays earlier this evening due to the fire in Ōtāhuhu there will continue to be some delays and cancellations across the Auckland rail network this evening."</p>
