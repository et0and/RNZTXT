            <p>Emergency services are at the scene of a large fire which has badly damaged a hair and beauty clinic in Auckland's Onehunga in Auckland.</p>
        
            <p>Photos from the scene near Onehunga Mall show a red glow from the blaze and billowing smoke.</p>
        
            <p>Fire and Emergency NZ said at least one person was evacuated from the commercial building which was ablaze, and about eight others were evacuated from accommodation in an adjoining building.</p>
        
            <p>FENZ had 12 fire trucks and multiple support vehicles battling the third alarm level fire at the two-storey building, and the fire was put out by about 6.30pm on Sunday night.</p>
        
            <p>The fire was at Chocolate Af'hair hair salon in Onehunga Mall. The neighbouring accommodation was affected by smoke exposure, but there were no signs it was involved in the fire.</p>
        
            <p>"We received multiple calls to a building on fire shortly after 5.30pm," a FENZ spokesman said.</p>
        
            <p>Upon arrival, crews located the blaze at the rear of a two-storey shop in a building about 15mx15m in size.</p>
        
            <p>"Multiple crews went inside the building to carry out a fire attack, before requesting further support."</p>
        
            <p>Seven fire engines, three ladder trucks and two specialist vehicles worked to extinguish the blaze alongside numerous support vehicles and a fire investigator.</p>
        
            <p>
Twelve fire trucks and support vehicles responded to the blaze.

            <p>FENZ said everyone was accounted for and no other buildings were in danger.</p>
        
            <p>Nearby resident Gina Lio told the Herald she was watching television at her home on Colonel Nixon Street when she smelt smoke in her living room.</p>
        
            <p>"When I came outside I saw black smoke and it smelt like burning chemicals."</p>
        
            <p>Lio said she walked over to the fire to take photos but had to leave shortly after because it was "too hard to breathe".</p>

            <p>"I can still smell it in my house and I'm getting a bit of a headache from it."</p>
        
            <p>Another witness said she could see multiple emergency services vehicles and a helicopter was circling overhead.</p>
        
            <p>Police closed off a portion of Trafalgar Street.</p>
        
            <p>The incident was a building fire, police said, and directed media queries to FENZ.</p>
        
            <p>"We're supporting with road closures in the immediate area."</p>
