            <p>Two men have been arrested after a person was shot during a large fight in West Auckland, with police saying people filmed the incident happening - and they want footage.</p>
        
            <p>Police received reports of a large group brawl on Waikumete Road in Glen Eden, at about 8pm on Friday.</p>
        
            <p>Acting Detective Senior Sergeant Matt Bartlett said a firearm was fired after the fight, and a person with a serious injury "consistent with a gunshot wound" was taken to hospital.</p>
        
            <p>Armed officers later stopped a car on nearby Claryburn Road and seized a firearm.</p>
        
            <p>Two men aged 23 and 27 years old were arrested, and face firearms charges and accessory charges, but more charges may be laid later, Bartlett said.</p>
        
            <p>"Police know people videoed the incident," he said, and asked that anyone who had a copy to hand it in.</p>
        
            <p>"We understand this may have been a distressing incident for anyone who witnessed it."</p>
        
            <p>The arrested men were scheduled to appear in Waitakere District Court on Saturday.</p>
        
            <p>Anyone with footage of the incident was asked to call Police on 105, or to visit their Update Report page online at 105.police.govt.nz and quote file number 240726/5258.</p>
        
            <p>Information could also be provided anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, or on their website.</p>
