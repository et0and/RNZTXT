        <h2>Five favourite woman characters from the small screen</h2>
        <p>
One-note characters used to be the norm for women on TV. But things are changing for the better, says Jogai Bhatt.

            <p>The portrayal of women in film and television hasn't always been so well-rounded. We've seen the same one-note tropes played out countless times; the weak-willed damsel-in-distress, or the cool girl that's just not like other girls. Always lacking any real complexity or dimension - and always serving a male fantasy of how women should be.</p>
        
            <p>In recent years, television has really stepped up - serving women characters that feel real and reflect an authentic existence. Here are a few of my favourites.</p>
        
            <p>
Ayo Edebiri as Sydney Adamu in The Bear.

</p>
        
            <p>Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) is ambitious, hard-working and so dedicated to her craft. She's a sous-chef at The Beef (and eventually The Bear) - the most chaotic, abusive back-kitchen in Chicago. Sydney dreams of revolutionising the restaurant into a respectful working environment, where the kitchen operates professionally, and staff feel nurtured in developing their skills.</p>
        
            <p>She's smart as hell and a little impatient, but it's because she has a vision and knows she can create real change. Ayo Edebiri does an incredible job of portraying this strong-willed, driven woman. Sydney doesn't tolerate fragile egos, and the show never admonishes her for her self-belief.</p>

Jane Kaczmarek as Lois Wilkerson in Malcolm in the Middle.

            <p>Lois is a hardworking mother and a loving wife - but she experiences a lot of anger and exhaustion in her daily life. And who wouldn't? Her sons are absolute rascals who frequently make poor decisions. She's overwhelmed holding down a job and looking after the household without much support from her family.</p>
        
            <p>But she loves her children and tries her best under the circumstances. The Wilkersons are poor, and flashbacks reveal the burden her parents and children have imparted on her over time. In fact, Lois was once a very caring and doting mother to her sons. Unfortunately, the little buggers are out of control, and a tough love approach is the only way to manage them. Lois is a rich, complex character: devoted, disciplined, loving and strong, and beautifully portrayed by Jane Kaczmarek.</p>

Animated character Diane Ngyguen in Bojack Horseman.

</p>
        
            <p>Diane holds herself to very high standards. She's a feminist tasked with writing the memoir of our flawed titular character - a womanising drunkard who constantly makes depressing decisions. She's shy, stubborn, intelligent and empathetic; all qualities she has to grapple with as she documents BoJack's life. She struggles with when to placate him, and when to hold him accountable. For a human character in an anthropomorphic world, she's remarkably real.</p>
        
            <p>Diane goes on several journeys of self-discovery throughout the show. She's a staunch feminist but sometimes struggles to practice what she preaches. She tries to explore her identity as a Vietnamese-American woman, but is honest with herself about not fully being able to connect culturally with her roots. And in the final season, she overcomes her fear of gaining weight and finally begins taking anti-depressants after realising that her happiness is more important than how people perceive her. Diane is brave and imperfect; a nuanced character voiced by Alison Brie.</p>
        
            <p>
Natasha Lyonne as Charlie Cale in Poker Face.

</p>
        
            <p>Charlie is a human lie-detector in this case-of-the-week murder mystery. She not only can sniff out BS - she bluntly calls it out too. After discovering the criminal activities of her casino employers, Charlie ditches her phone and escapes on a cross-country road trip. At each place, she encounters a suspicious cast of characters and avenges a new injustice at each stop.</p>
        
            <p>She's brave, intelligent, compassionate, and a little unusual - the mysteries she encounters don't seem to faze her much. Natasha Lyonne's disheveled look and raspy voice really bring this accidental detective to life.</p>

Katara in Avatar: The Last Airbender (2005).

</p>
        
            <p>Katara was a revolutionary character for a children's animated show. At the time Avatar: The Last Airbender premiered on Nickelodeon in 2005, many of the network's woman characters were resigned to the curse being "not like other girls", in order to be deemed likeable or valuable or worth caring about. Katara broke the mold because she was like other girls. Nurturing, kind, gentle; the glue that held her group together. And she was fierce and hot-headed.</p>
        
            <p>Katara learned waterbending in society that only saw women and girls as healers. She chose to become a warrior - and a healer - embracing all parts of her being and never limiting herself to the world she was born into.</p>
