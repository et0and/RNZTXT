        <h2>Asking workers to return to the office can drive away top talent</h2>

            <p>Opinion: As the founder of a flexible career platform and with a decade in corporate leadership, I've seen the toll the traditional model of working can take on people and the effects of stress, anxiety, burn out and guilt. Guilt at a tough drop off, guilt being the last parent at daycare pickup, and guilt when work and life come hurtling together and you're at swimming lessons on the laptop.</p>
        
            <p>I've certainly felt all these things, and it was my main motivator in developing a flexible work platform, one that has seen a surge of site visits since the public sector and several major New Zealand corporations decided we all needed to be back in the office full time, despite the evidence against it.</p>
        
            <p>Post the public sector announcement to revert to all things traditional, our flexible working platform, Jobs for Mums, has seen over 120,000 page visits and 680,000 page views from people actively seeking flexible job opportunities, with a notable rise in inquiries from candidates eager to leave employers who are scaling back on flexibility.</p>
        
            <p>I urge businesses to think twice before hopping on the office-only bandwagon because you're missing out on highly educated, experienced talent.</p>
        
            <p>It's a tough time out there for businesses, but remote working isn't the problem, in fact, it's an opportunity. An opportunity to hire talent you can't otherwise afford to steer your business through a tough economic climate.</p>
        
            <p>Flexible options, such as part-time roles during school hours, not only support working parents but also lead to more focused, productive work, and it's one of the most effective retention tools for businesses today.</p>
        
            <p>Recent job data shows that 78 percent of New Zealanders seeking new roles value flexible work options, and The Jobs for Mums database includes more than 25,000 people with an average of 10 years' experience, and 70 percent with a tertiary or higher level of education seeking flexibility.</p>
        
            <p>Businesses can benefit from top level operating, marketing, human resources and production talent to name a few by being brave and remaining flexible in a tide that's turning to the traditional model.</p>
        
            <p>In uncertain times, businesses may reduce flexibility to regain control. However, investing in effective management and leadership training to guide remote, diverse teams is a better option. A flexible workforce remains a powerful asset that offers wide-reaching benefits, including improving family well-being, reducing poverty, supporting gender equity, and of course increasing productivity and reducing costs.</p>
        
            <p>Don't revert back to traditional offer work models just because it's the easiest option, when being flexible and thinking creatively is the best path to growing your business.</p>
        
            <p>I encourage employers to embrace flexibility as a strategic advantage. As the work landscape evolves, businesses that prioritise flexibility will remain competitive, attract the best talent, reduce costs and come out the other side of today's harsh operating conditions better for it.</p>
