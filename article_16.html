            <p>First Person - Almost two weeks ago, Sir Robert "Bom" Gillies, the last remaining member of the Māori Battalion, died. RNZ reporter Ashleigh McCaull, who has whānau and lineage ties, reports on his tangihanga.</p>
        
            <p>Earlier this week I had the privilege of covering Sir Robert Gillies' tangihanga back home in Rotorua, at a time where Māoridom is facing a tumultuous period.</p>
        
            <p>Also known as "Bom", he was the last remaining member of the 28th Māori Battalion, serving in B Company from 1942 to 1945.</p>
        
            <p>He died on 7 November aged 99, and was laid to rest at Kauae Cemetery alongside his wife on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>Hikoi mō te Tiriti also coincided with his tangi in its final two days, but regardless, hundreds arrived to pay their final respects.</p>
        
            <p>Reporting on his tangi was a very special experience for many different reasons including culturally, through lineage and whānau ties.</p>
        
            <p>This was the first time reporting from my own marae and hometown in Rotorua in my 8-year career, and this realisation in the car was quite overwhelming.</p>
        
            <p>It felt like a full circle moment, as I had the privilege of reporting on his knighthood about two and a half years ago as my first story when I first started at RNZ.</p>

            <p>Across from Te Papaiouru Marae is St Faith's church where Sir Robert Gillies spent a lot of time and also where my great-great-grandfather, Frederick Augustus Bennett, is buried inside.</p>
        
            <p>He was the first Māori Anglican Bishop of New Zealand and I descend from his second wife Arihia Bennett.</p>
        
            <p>One of his sons, Sir Charles Bennett, was a lieutenant colonel and fought alongside Tā Gillies in the 28th Māori Battalion.</p>
        
            <p>My great-grandfather was his brother, Paratene Bennett, who like many young men at the time, lied about his age, and enrolled in the Royal English Navy.</p>
        
            <p>This church was also a place where I was christened as a baby.</p>
        
            <p>My grandfather Camera McCaull was also good friends with Sir Bom's son, also named Robert Gillies.</p>
        
            <p>I remember one year Tā Gillies' son and his son's wife came over to our place to celebrate my brother and grandfather's combined birthday party.</p>
        
            <p>That friendship also extended to my great-grandmother, Iri McCaull.</p>
        
            <p>While driving up to Rotorua on Monday from Wellington, I stopped off in Taupō where I met with my dad for lunch and he reminisced about when he was six, spending christmas out at Tā Gillies' place with my nanny Iri at their house.</p>
        
            <p>During the tangi, I felt the true essence of Te Arawa when the haukāinga from Ngāti Whakaue entertained manuhiri through waiata and kapa haka whether it was while they were eating lunch, or waiting for Tā Bom's service to start.</p>

            <p>There was a lot of kōrero about how he fought for Māori soldiers to be acknowledged for their service in World War II and spoke out against the unfair treatment he and other Māori soldiers faced when they returned home.</p>
        
            <p>Speaking with Returned Services Association President, Sir Wayne "Buck" Shelford at his tangi, Sir Wayne also acknowledged there is still underlying racism and discrimination at RSAs around the country.</p>
        
            <p>Some of Sir Robert Gillies' wishes were met while he was still alive including a 28th Māori Battalion Battle Honours flag which was flown for the first time last year at Waitangi and proudly at his tangi.</p>
        
            <p>Just days before he died, Defence Force Major General Rose King visited him at his home where she informed him of the Māori contingent finally being acknowledged with battle honours emblazoned on ceremonial flags.</p>
        
            <p>With Hikoi mō te Tiriti set to descend onto Parliament's footsteps on Tuesday with many Māori opposing the Treaty Principles Bill and the government's policies that affect Māori, Sir Robert Gillies' fight for fair treatment towards Māori is still going, almost 80 years after he fought in World War II.</p>
