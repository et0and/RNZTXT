            <p>Analysis - National's Tama Potaka could have been mistaken for giving advice to his own leader when he told Newshub on Friday morning "the New Zealand taxpayer is not a free ATM card".</p>
        
            <p>The Māori Development Minister, speaking on a panel with Labour MP Willie Jackson on Newshub's AM show, made the remark when discussing whether the government will help bail Newshub out.</p>
        
            <p>The show is one of many set to be axed in June after Warner Brothers Discovery told staff on Wednesday it planned to close Newshub due to insurmountable business losses.</p>
        
            <p>Potaka's comments came on the same morning Newsroom revealed Christopher Luxon is claiming a $52,000 accommodation supplement despite owning a mortgage-free home in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon owns seven properties including his apartment in the capital, all of which are mortgage-free according to Parliament's pecuniary interests register.</p>
        
            <p>A $31,000 allowance is able to be claimed by MPs who are living away from home when they're in Wellington, but the prime minister's subsidy is higher and is a top-up of his $471,000 salary.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister will have an opportunity to defend his decision for claiming the allowance when he faces questions from media this afternoon in Queenstown.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon campaigned on wasteful public spending and a need for cost cutting across the public service, and under the coalition government ministries have been asked to find at least 6.5 percent in savings.</p>
        
            <p>Pressure is now mounting on Luxon as to why he is collecting the subsidy at the same time he's spearheading a programme of widespread cuts.</p>
        
            <p>The same pressure Luxon is facing was mounted on Bill English when he collected the accommodation supplement to live in his family home in Wellington.</p>
        
            <p>English ended up paying it back and Luxon will need to decide whether the backlash is worth the 11 percent top-up of his salary.</p>
        
            <p>It won't be lost on New Zealanders the subsidy is more than what those earning the minimum wage take home each year.</p>
        
            <p>Prime ministers have Premier House to live in when they're in Wellington, but Luxon told media this week he was continuing to stay in his apartment because of long-standing maintenance issues at the official residence.</p>
        
            <p>He has received a report about the problems with Premier House but is yet to make a decision about whether to push ahead with renovations.</p>
        
            <p>Spending taxpayer money on tidying up the dated home at the same time the coalition is instructing the public service to tighten up would be a difficult sell for the prime minister.</p>
        
            <p>For that reason, Luxon has put off any decisions about whether to renovate or not.</p>
        
            <p>It was only 10 days ago the prime minister declared on social media "the days of taxpayers being treated like a bottomless ATM are over".</p>
        
            <p>The days of taxpayers being treated like a bottomless ATM are over.</p>
        
            <p>Luxon now needs to explain why collecting taxpayer cash to live in his own home is perfectly acceptable.</p>
