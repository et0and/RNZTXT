            <p>Analysis - Consider China an 'opportunity and partner rather than a challenge or threat' - that was the message Xi Jinping delivered to Christopher Luxon at their face-to-face meeting, according to Chinese state-run media.</p>
        
            <p>It's an insight into how China is pitching itself to the Asia-Pacific region and beyond as threats of worldwide tariffs from the incoming Donald Trump Administration put small trade-dependent economies on edge.</p>
        
            <p>While the prime minister said Trump's promised tariffs weren't specifically raised with him in any of his roughly a dozen bilaterals and pull-asides on the margins of the APEC Summit in Peru, he did say increasing protectionism and the breakdown of the rules-based system featured heavily.</p>
        
            <p>Talking about those two things is a diplomatic way to raise concerns about the incoming US President.</p>
        
            <p>Protectionism is precisely what Trump has been campaigning on - putting America first, which translated means putting every other country second.</p>

            <p>When one in four jobs in New Zealand depends on trade, a sizeable two-way partner shutting its door to products - unless a premium is paid - is a devastating proposition.</p>
        
            <p>That's why Luxon spent most of his whirlwind two days in Peru advocating for small exporting economies to band together to create more influence and power.</p>
        
            <p>It's also why he warned of power replacing rules, and arguing the trading institutions that have traditionally ensured order - like the World Trade Organisation - need to evolve and strengthen.</p>
        
            <p>Further complicating the increasingly fragmented geopolitical environment countries are operating in is what exactly China plans to do in response.</p>
        
            <p>For now, it is holding itself up as the champion of free trade - an interesting juxtaposition for New Zealand, a country that also proudly heralds itself as being a shining light when it comes to open trade.</p>
        
            <p>Politically New Zealand and China have nothing in common, and for decades bilateral meeting talking points between the two nations' leaders have split time between commonalities - trade - and differences - human rights abuses, missile testing, and aggression in the Pacific.</p>
        
            <p>China's issues and concerns with New Zealand are more often than not the reverse position of whatever alarming development was raised with it first.</p>
        
            <p>On human rights abuses China disagrees, on missile testing it says it's not a big deal, and on its aggression in the Pacific, it denies that's the case.</p>
        
            <p>In fact, it now views alliances, like those between Australia, the UK and the US, as responsible for the aggression.</p>
        
            <p>At Luxon's meeting with President Xi on Saturday China raised its concerns about New Zealand interest joining Pillar Two of the AUKUS pact.</p>
        
            <p>In response, Luxon told media Sunday that he sees AUKUS as a positive for stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
        
            <p>It's a complete unknown as to how Trump will approach AUKUS and whether its parameters or intentions might shift next year.</p>
        
            <p>In the meantime, the position being taken by New Zealand on China is that, while it's an opportunity and partner from a trade perspective, it remains a potential threat and challenge to the region.</p>
