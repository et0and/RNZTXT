Charities such as food banks, aid organisations and community groups - and the work they do - could be affected significantly by possible changes to their tax free earnings status, which is currently out for consultation, two University of Waikato academics say.

            <p>Opinion - There have long been calls for New Zealand's charity-linked businesses to lose their tax exemption status. Under the current rules, companies such as Sanitarium, which is wholly owned by the Seventh-day Adventist church, pay no income tax.</p>
        
            <p>This could all change very soon.</p>
        
            <p>Inland Revenue recently opened consultation on rule changes that would include taxing business income unrelated to a charity's charitable purpose. The consultation period runs until the end of this month.</p>
        
            <p>But overhauling the tax rules could undermine the sustainability of some charities, making it harder for them to continue their work.</p>
        
            <p>Our ongoing research looks into the economic contribution of the sector and, in particular, focuses on religious charities. The total value of the services provided by these charities in 2018 alone was NZ$6.1 billion - the equivalent of about 3 percent of annual government expenditure.</p>
        
            <p>Other studies have shown the substantial contributions charities make to education, sports, the arts, the environment and other activities that don't get enough support from the government.</p>
        
            <p>There are more than 29,000 registered charities in New Zealand. To register as one, an entity must meet strict legal criteria entrenched in the Charities Act 2005.</p>
        
            <p>Charities have to fall within one of four legally-recognised charitable purposes: relief of poverty, advancement of education, advancement of religion, and any other purposes beneficial to the community.</p>
        
            <p>The government recognises the high bar charities have to meet by giving some tax exemptions. This allows the charities to focus on providing benefits to communities rather than having to divert funds to the government. The exemptions are on both passive income (stocks, for example) as well as business income.</p>
        
            <p>But the issue is not as simple as certain criticisms might imply.</p>
        
            <p>Charities need to sustain themselves over time - particularly as donations fluctuate. Untaxed profits from charity-linked businesses allow them to do this, and changing the rules could undermine future cash flow for these groups.</p>
        
            <p>This argument should not be overstated. Removing the exemption won't completely wipe out a charity's profits. But it takes a portion of income that would then need to be covered by an increase in donations.</p>
        
            <p>The Inland Revenue discussion paper also only offers examples of businesses in the primary industry (farming, for example) and manufacturing sectors. But it is silent about the financial and services sectors. It appears charities' income from interest or financial assets will still be exempt.</p>
        
            <p>This is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
        
            <p>Holding assets such as a portfolio of stocks or bonds can improve charities' ability to plan for the long term. But the tax rules should remain consistent between financial assets and non-financial assets, such as a farm or business.</p>

The Sanitarium Health and Well-being Company, the manufacturer of Weet-Bix, Marmite and other well known grocery items, is wholly owned by the Seventh-Day Adventist Church and does not pay income tax.

            <p>To better balance the contribution of charities to wider society with efforts to make tax rules fair, there are a few points the government needs to consider.</p>
        
            <p>Having public consultation on Inland Revenue's proposed changes is a good start, but it is just that.</p>
        
            <p>More needs to be done to understand the implications for communities should tax changes occur - and what could be lost if charities are substantially less sustainable. So, if the government delivers a plan, let's read and evaluate the small print.</p>
