            <p>Analysis - The housing market is reporting a bumper crop of offerings for the first time in almost a decade, and prices are still low. Here's what moved real estate this week.</p>
        
            <p>House prices are rising at a much lower rate than the number of houses popping up for sale, and first-home buyers are swooping in.</p>
        
            <p>They are slowly being followed by investors, who are seeing a light called interest deductibility at the end of the tunnel.</p>
        
            <p>The national average asking price was just under $887,000 - up $27,000 from March last year.</p>
        
            <p>Central Otago was the region with the highest average asking price in the country, the latest Property Report by Real Estate New Zealand found.</p>
        
            <p>The West Coast had the lowest average asking price, which surpassed the $500,000 mark last month for only the second time in 17 years.</p>
        
            <p>The property market was very suppressed in 2023, with eight of the 12 months having the lowest listings on record for that month, realestate.co.nz spokesperson Vanessa Williams told Morning Report.</p>
        
            <p>CoreLogic's House Price Index rose 0.5 percent in March, similar to January and February's muted gains, taking values 1.1 percent up over the first quarter of 2024.</p>
        
            <p>"NZ's housing market can probably be described as 'not too hot, not too cold," CoreLogic NZ chief property economist Kelvin Davidson said.</p>
        
            <p>The increase in listings in the first quarter had helped to take the heat out of price increases.</p>
        
            <p>However, Davidson said low prices, coupled with interest deductibility would not trump interest rates yet.</p>
        
            <p>Landlords can again claim tax deductions for interest on residential investment properties, but experts aren't convinced it will lower rent prices.</p>
        
            <p>From 1 April, landlords are able to write off 80 percent of their mortgage interest, and that will rise to 100 percent from April 2025.</p>
        
            <p>The deduction scheme was removed by the previous government, and reinstating it was part of the coalition agreement between National and Act.</p>
        
            <p>Davidson said although it would not necessarily decrease rent prices, it might slow their growth.</p>
        
            <p>Property Investors Federation president Sue Harrison said it would be about two years until the benefits of interest deductibility began to trickle down - and whether rent increased, depended on interest rates.</p>
        
            <p>The RBNZ has hinted that lower interest rates are on the horizon, but lower shorter-term fixed mortgage rates are not expected to drop much for another six to nine months.</p>
        
            <p>The OCR - which is reviewed seven times a year - is next up for review on 10 April. It currently sits at 5.5 percent.</p>
        
            <p>Inflation is at 4.7 percent.</p>
        
            <p>The first quarter report by credit agency Centrix showed mortgage payment arrears rose 1.5 percent in February. There were 22,600 mortgage holders behind on their payments - the highest level since January 2020 - while mortgage applications were down 6 percent on the year earlier, reflecting a drop in sales volumes.</p>
        
            <p>In a bid to make houses affordable, the government loosened the rules allowing builders to use overseas building products by just being able to rely on standards from trusted overseas jurisdictions.</p>
        
            <p>Making the announcement on Thursday, Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk said it was currently about "50 percent more expensive to build a stand-alone house here than in Australia".</p>
        
            <p>He said it was one of several changes, like the RMA, that would help housing affordability.</p>
        
            <p>The building industry welcomed the move, but also sounded the alarm on the "risk of fraudulent activity" overseas that would need to be monitored.</p>
        
            <p>This week, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon laid out a new "action plan" that includes 36 goals to be achieved by 30 June 2024.</p>
        
            <p>It includes:</p>
        
            <p>An Auckland University study found the Auckland Unitary Plan improved housing affordability.</p>
        
            <p>indicated that about 22,000 new homes consented between 2016 and 2021 can be directly attributed to the Auckland Unitary Plan.</p>
        
            <p>Implemented in 2016, the unitary plan allowed for about 400,000 new homes to be built across the region.</p>
        
            <p>Community housing providers are putting the brakes on building desperately needed homes because there's no guarantee of government funding after June next year.</p>
        
            <p>The government pays rent subsidies to community housing providers, which they rely on to operate.</p>
        
            <p>But the funding is soon to dry up, leaving providers in the lurch, delaying construction on consented land that's ready to build.</p>
