Analysis - Artificial intelligence-enabled cameras on billboards, in bus windshields, on petrol station forecourts and in the checkout at the supermarket - allâ€¦

The wide array of cameras and technology gathering information about our day-to-day life can be hard to get an overview of, says RNZ's Phil Pennington.

            <p>Analysis - Artificial intelligence-enabled cameras on billboards, in bus windshields, on petrol station forecourts and in the checkout at the supermarket - all these are here, or about to be.</p>
        
            <p>The selling of surveillance for safety and security's sake has been very successful around the world, and in New Zealand.</p>
        
            <p>It has proceeded apace, with barely a blip - though just this week a legal challenge to it has been playing out in the Auckland District Court, without any coverage by the media.</p>
        
            <p>In that hearing, expected to involve at least four separate criminal cases challenging police use for evidence of footage gathered without a warrant from CCTV retail cameras linked to automated number plate recognition (ANPR) systems, the ruling was reserved.</p>
        
            <p>Another wee blip came after RNZ reported last year that new billboards at Wellington's train stations would sport cameras from the same Swedish company that supplies surveillance products to China. In a quick-about, the billboard company ditched the cameras.</p>
        
            <p>
MetLink began installing large digital billboards at Wellington railway stations last year, despite not being aware of the cameras embedded in them.

            <p>A third speed bump came just last week, when NZTA deferred using number-plate spotting cameras on a highway (see below).</p>
        
            <p>The march is mostly one way, though - including to the bank for the tech-makers and marketers, who are known to protest at the media calling their products "surveillance".</p>
        
            <p>Such sensitivities have not put off governments spending on public-private hybrid systems.</p>
        
            <p>New Zealand has its own, used by powerful state agencies, the police and Immigration.</p>
        
            <p>Many of the camera systems could run facial recognition (FR). Sometimes you are just asked to trust the FR function is not switched on.</p>
        
            <p>A quick swing-around what we know about the surveilled society:</p>

            <p>Cameras are not quite the least of surveillance, but are only one part of it.</p>
        
            <p>Another is the spread of systems that do not rely on cameras but surveil anyway, collecting data on you about where you go and what you do, and storing it and possibly sharing it, under agreements and contracts aimed at protecting your privacy and keeping your profile from becoming a tradeable commodity, though that has not worked so well elsewhere, such as on social media platforms.</p>
        
            <p>Such as:</p>
        
            <p>Though it seems there is always room for more surveillance, it is not as if New Zealand has eyes everywhere. Other countries are much closer to blanket coverage.</p>
        
            <p>Of the billion-plus CCTV cameras in the world, China has the most, the US an awful lot, and Africa not many. While by some rough estimates New Zealand has one camera for every 12 people, Shanghai has one-for-two.</p>
        
            <p>A crucial development is that public agencies used to buy the hardware and run it, and so keep the data in-house; now they often buy in complete packages in a build-operate contract with the tech company that often harvests and stores the data.</p>
        
            <p>Just as there has been software-as-a-service (SaaS) for a while, there is also now surveillance-as-a-service.</p>
        
            <p>Again, it is convenient, and the proliferation of this new type of SaaS did not get in the way of New Zealand recently signing up to a US-led 'Joint statement on efforts to counter the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware'.</p>
