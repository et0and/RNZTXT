            <p>Opinion - Disabled people around the country are feeling a mixture of disappointment and relief in the new coalition government's first Budget.</p>
        
            <p>There is relief that there is a funding boost for Whaikaha to ensure continuity of disability support funding. There is also deep disappointment that much-needed flexibility for individualised funding and respite care was not restored.</p>
        
            <p>The $1.1 billion of new funding was across a five-year timeframe, amounting to an average increase of $220 million per year. This extra money will enable the disability support system to continue operating, but without a lot of the flexibility available before.</p>
        
            <p>The fact there was a funding boost, but not a restoration in flexibility, tells us that government has not been listening to disabled people, families, whānau and carers throughout the motu who have been speaking out at rallies, in the media and in letters to ministers.</p>
        
            <p>Our primary call was for the return of flexibility, because having it gives disabled people and whānau the control to determine what supports work for us as individuals. We know from many years of trials that flexibility leads to improved safety and wellbeing outcomes for disabled people.</p>
        
            <p>We are also awaiting, with trepidation, the outcome of the disability support review implemented by Disability Issues Minister Louise Upston. The review panel needs to listen to Aotearoa's disability community and convey to government our views, including our need for flexible support.</p>
        
            <p>Equally importantly, disability support changes are not the only government policy that have impacted on this country's disabled community.</p>

            <p>As made clear in a report released this week by the Disabled Persons Assembly (DPA) and Fairer Futures, entitled A Thousand Cuts, and in an open letter to Finance Minister Nicola Willis and Upston (now signed by over 60 organisations), the cumulative impacts of the coalition government's policies - announced both before the Budget and within it - will make life harder for many disabled people.</p>
        
            <p>Cumulative impacts range across government policies in employment, health, housing, welfare and</p>
        
            <p>Te Tiriti, among others.</p>
        
            <p>From DPA's analysis of the Budget and earlier announced measures, we identified the following impacts:</p>
        
            <p>Whilst our worst fears weren't realised in Budget 2024, we are aware that the impact of many of the policy changes being brought in for disabled people will only become apparent as the year progresses.</p>
        
            <p>Disabled Person's Assembly will continue to watch this space and to speak out for disabled people's rights.</p>
