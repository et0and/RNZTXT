            <p>Analysis - If you've been bombarded with content and commentary about Australian fashion label Witchery lately and you're wondering what's going on, you're not alone.</p>
        
            <p>It's a hot topic in the fashion world right now - and maybe it's just my algorithm serving me this content - but it seems as though the majority of the sentiment has been negative.</p>
        
            <p>However, this is no witch-hunt.</p>
        
            <p>Their rebrand has sparked controversy for a number of reasons, including removing size 20 from their offering and releasing a collection that was quite basic for the price point - all pretty underwhelming for a brand promising and teasing a 'bold awakening'.</p>
        
            <p>Here's the thing, I've only just recently discovered that Witchery carries a size 20, and when I found out I immediately rushed to my closest store to try a blazer on. As someone who loves fashion and exists in a bigger body, it is rare to be able to find a blazer in a reasonable price point that I can actually physically try in store.</p>
        
            <p>Most brands comparable to Witchery in the market don't often cater to a bigger size, so when I saw online that not only did they have a more diverse range of bodies in their marketing imagery, I literally ran, not walked, to the store.</p>
        
            <p>I was so stoked to fit this blazer, and since this discovery I've actually shopped the brand more than I ever have. I've acquired a few pieces in a size 18 and 20 in a short amount of time and I was excited to finally have this option.</p>
        
            <p>I bought well fitted blazers, coats, and skirts in fabrics that I would normally not fit in stores.</p>

            <p>I was actually in one of the stores when I found out about the rebrand going live a few days later.</p>
        
            <p>I was trying out a satin maxi dress that looked so lovely on my body, and again in a fabric that doesn't usually get used to cater to this dress size in store, and I remember feeling so excited when they told me that they had a very great range launching, with a colour palette that I was really into.</p>
        
            <p>So imagine my surprise when on the day of launch, I went online and saw that the size 20 was completely gone.</p>
        
            <p>In 2024, when more consumers are being vocal about the fact that they want more size inclusivity, Witchery indeed made the 'bold' choice to take themselves off that market.</p>
        
            <p>I did some research and saw that the brand addressed it by saying: "If you were a size 20 with Witchery before, we welcome you to try an 18 instead".</p>
        
            <p>For a clothing brand who you'd think would know better, they don't seem to understand size differences. Nor have they considered the fact that the average size of a woman in New Zealand and Australia is a size 14, so they only now carry two sizes above that, and five below.</p>
        
            <p>The disparity between carrying sizes considered XS and XXS (Witchery starts with a 4) but not XXL anymore sends a strong message. In this day and age, with the budgets and production access that Witchery has, doing so is a deliberate choice.</p>
        
            <p>While I think the new collection is beautiful, and the pieces are elevated and timeless while still feeling current, I'm disappointed to say the least.</p>
        
            <p>For one, it took me this long to discover that Witchery carried up to a size 20, and the world of shopping just opened up a little bit more for those of us not existing in a straight sized body.</p>
        
            <p>I've been reading comments, and one of the points raised was that perhaps size 20 wasn't selling and that's why it was cut. And to that I say - if it took me this long to find out that Witchery had a decent size range, and I'm someone in the fashion industry, how would the average consumer find out?</p>
        
            <p>I know for a lot of plus sized people, we don't really check out stores that historically have excluded us, so my question is, how committed was Witchery to marketing that reflected this diversity?</p>
        
            <p>To offer the solution 'just try a size 18 and see' is insulting to their customer base and fans alike.</p>
        
            <p>We already know how hard it is to find the correct size, as that's dependent on so many factors - cut, fabric, style. Not to mention body shape.</p>
        
            <p>To disregard their size 20 customers, after they've already shown us that it is possible to cater to our bodies if they really wanted to, is a pretty bold awakening.</p>
