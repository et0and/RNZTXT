            <p>Analysis - If a perfect metaphor exists for the Wellington Phoenix's loss to Melbourne City over the weekend it was what happened in the minutes before they conceded their second in a 2-0 defeat.</p>
        
            <p>Lukas Kelly-Heald was subbed into the game and he came armed with a piece of paper, detailing a tactical and/or formational shift from the Phoenix bench. This, seemingly, was the last roll of the dice at saving a point at AAMI Park.</p>
        
            <p>But they never got a chance to test Giancarlo Italiano's latest plan in anger. After Paulo Retre had a peruse the note ended up in stand-in captain Scott Wootton's hands. He looked at it two, maybe three times, and stuffed it into his sock. Less than a minute later Nathaniel Atkinson punted in the decider.</p>
        
            <p>Once again, the best laid plans of Chiefy and co went awry - as it had done for the entire 90 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington were second best throughout yet again at their traditional Victorian wasteland and, unfortunately, it was much their own doing. Melbourne City, shorn of a litany of big names due to injury, swamped the Phoenix's gameplan to pass out from the back with an intense press which offered them nearly total control over the Kiwi side.</p>
        
            <p>Of course, playing in this manner is always going to be risky but this went beyond the odd mistake here and there. It was systematically countered by City who, on the two occasions they pooled a couple of passes together on the edge of the Phoenix box, scored.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, this is now part of an alarming trend for the Phoenix. This was their fifth loss of the season, more than the entirety of last year's second-place regular season finish. It was also their fourth loss in five, the only win coming courtesy of two special goals against Newcastle.</p>
        
            <p>The lack of attacking impetus is clear. Phoenix had just two touches in the opposing box, Luke Brooke-Smith accounting for one with the only effort on Patrick Beach's goal they mustered.</p>
        
            <p>This counterpunch, beat the press style worked for the Phoenix last season but that was when the likes of Ben Old and Bozhidar Kraev were ripping through at the sharp end. Marco Rojas was supposed to replace the Bulgarian but has struggled with injury. Meanwhile, Hideki Ishige, for all his talents, has struggled to match the physical nature of the league in recent weeks.</p>
        
            <p>Add to that the fact captain Alex Rufer, so key to the transition from defence to attack, has been playing with glandular fever and is now set for a spell on the sidelines. Not to mention Tim Payne playing through the pain of ongoing ankle issues and it's no wonder the Phoenix are struggling.</p>
        
            <p>Italiano is clearly a competent coach and demonstrated that last year. Perhaps he is thinking long-term, ensuring these players have the chance to play his preferred game now so they might grow into it and have success later. It is, after all, a philosophy for Italiano that took the Phoenix so close to glory 2023-24. Short-term pain for long-term gain sort of vibes. If so, then this season is something of a tanking, to borrow and manipulate some American parlance.</p>
        
            <p>Whether that is the long-term plan or not? Only Chiefy knows. And in Chiefy we trust. But without a better Plan B then the rushed scribblings stuck to the inside of Scotty Wootton's shin pads this season will go no further than the regular season for the Phoenix.</p>

            <p>In other football news:</p>
        
            <p>Auckland FC didn't fare much better in front of goal in their New Year's Day clash with Melbourne Victory at Mount Smart. Their second draw of the season, a 0-0 stalemate, was largely due to the goalkeeping exploits of Jack Duncan - Alex Paulsen's understudy at the Wellington Phoenix last term.</p>
        
            <p>Wellington Phoenix's men may be having a hard time, but the women are enjoying a great run of form. A 2-0 win over Perth Glory has moved the Wahinix into the A-League Women's top six.</p>
