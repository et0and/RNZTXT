            <p>Analysis - That was, without a doubt, Moana Pasifika's finest hour.</p>
        
            <p>Their 45-29 win over the Crusaders wasn't their first victory over heavily fancied opposition, won't be the last, but should be celebrated as a landmark achievement.</p>
        
            <p>Not simply because they won, but because for the first time ever, they thoroughly outplayed their opposition and made an All Black-laden team look like a pack of chumps by the time the ref blew full time.</p>
        
            <p>It's tempting to think that the Crusaders simply slipped back into their habits from last year, and they certainly gave away enough territory through bad penalties, but really Moana were that good it wouldn't have mattered.</p>
        
            <p>Moana picked up where they left off in their crazy game last weekend against the Chiefs, in which they outscored the competition leaders 28-7 in the second half.</p>
        
            <p>Their main issue for their entire existence has been defence and while they conceded an early Crusaders try, tackles were made and territory held in an otherwise note-perfect first half. Moana are always good for around 30-plus points a game, they just needed to stop conceding.</p>
        
            <p>It's easy to pin this on the influence of Ardie Savea, however, it's clear the All Black loose forward has managed to get the rest of the Moana squad into his desire to win and change things.</p>
        
            <p>Most of them are playing the best rugby of their careers - in fact, if Patrick Pellegrini hadn't been capped for Tonga it's likely he'd be in the conversation for a Wallabies call-up later this year.</p>
        
            <p>Pellegrini was at the heart of everything Moana did and added another valuable goal-kicking performance, while outside him Danny Toala was looking more like Ma'a Nonu on both sides of the ball.</p>
        
            <p>Miracle Faiilagi scored another try, Jonathan Taumateine's gamesmanship included milking a penalty off the All Black captain of all people, and Abraham Pole's contribution off the bench was immense.</p>

            <p>That's just highlighting a few. The Crusaders were poor, for sure, but the talk today should definitely be about how good Moana was first and foremost.</p>
        
            <p>While it doesn't shake up the table too much, the result did prevent the Crusaders from going top. While that will be satisfying enough for Moana, the bonus came at the other end because it also means the Blues are now joint last.</p>
        
            <p>The two sides meet in a fortnight at Eden Park, in a match that now has an awful lot more meaning than anyone thought it would.</p>
        
            <p>Much had been made about the Crusaders being 'back' (whoops), but the Hurricanes put in their best effort of the year so far on Friday night to send a bit of a belated message of their own.</p>
        
            <p>Everything seemed to go right after about half an hour at Sky Stadium against the Waratahs, although the 57-12 win is more of a stepping stone to Moana's landmark.</p>
        
            <p>Because really, the Canes should've been playing like this much earlier in the season. The efforts of their loose forwards have been outstanding, and it was good to see the rest of the side build on it.</p>
        
            <p>The Highlanders seem to be heading in a different direction, unfortunately. Friday night's 34-27 loss to the Brumbies was their third in a row by seven points or less, which must be giving Jamie Joseph headaches.</p>
        
            <p>The one major positive is the form of Caleb Tangitau, who has been an ideal signing from the Blues, but they're going to have to figure out how to come right at the business end of games if they want to play a part in the finals.</p>
        
            <p>Don't look now, but an Australian team is on top of Super Rugby Pacific after seven rounds. The Reds went to the top spot after their 28-24 win over the Force in a very good game in Brisbane, which means their match on Friday night against the Chiefs is a top-of-the-table clash.</p>
