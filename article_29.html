Explainer - MPs are about to get a pay bump, but is it fair and how does it compare to other countries?

            <p>Politicians' pay packets are about to get fatter thanks to a staggered 10 percent salary increase this term.</p>
        
            <p>The Remuneration Authority has determined MPs should earn more after an extensive review of their pay system.</p>
        
            <p>Although the authority is an independent body - a point MPs have stressed since hearing the news - its findings are already raising eyebrows.</p>
        
            <p>Many households are struggling to pay the bills as recessionary pressures bite down - while police staff and their bosses are at loggerheads in pay talks.</p>
        
            <p>Is it really fair our elected representatives are earning more? Here's what we know.</p>
        
            <p>Every MP will get a 2.8 percent pay rise, backdated to last October.</p>
        
            <p>This will be followed by another 2.9 percent increase from July, a further 2.4 percent next year and another 2 percent in 2026.</p>
        
            <p>By the end of this Parliamentary term, an ordinary MP's salary will be $181,200.</p>
        
            <p>The prime minister's salary will be $520,000 and the deputy prime minister's will be $369,800.</p>
        
            <p>Cabinet minister's will get $327,000 by 2026 and ministers outside Cabinet $276,000.</p>
        
            <p>The leader of the opposition will get $309,000.</p>
        
            <p>The Remuneration Authority looked at the pay and responsibilities of MPs in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
        
            <p>It found that, even taking a cautious approach to the data, a New Zealand MP's salary is generally lower than that of their colleagues in other countries.</p>
        
            <p>MPs in New Zealand earn twice the local median wage while their Canadian counterparts earn 3.1 times the average local salary.</p>
        
            <p>MPs in Australia earn 2.7 times their median wage, MPs in the UK 2.6 times their median wage, and MPs in the Republic of Ireland 1.9 times their median wage.</p>
        
            <p>The authority also found New Zealand's PM earns less than their comparative counterparts and much less than what public officials and private sector chief executives get paid.</p>

            <p>The Remuneration Authority says its new pay rate aligns with other roles with comparable levels of responsibility in the New Zealand market.</p>
        
            <p>Police officers earn $75,000 to $83,000, primary school teachers $49,000 to $89,000 and nurses $74,000 to $153,000 a year, according to careers.govt.nz.</p>
        
            <p>It is worth nothing the authority is legally compelled to consider "any prevailing adverse economic conditions" and can determine the remuneration at a rate lower than it would have otherwise set.</p>
        
            <p>"The authority is confident that this outcome is appropriate in accordance with the Act's criteria," its report said.</p>
        
            <p>Wellingtonians RNZ spoke to have mixed feelings about the move putting up a range of descriptions from "stupid" and "indecent" to "pretty reasonable" and "probably okay".</p>
        
            <p>One woman said: "They're getting a pay increase, are you kidding?"</p>
        
            <p>"Oh, that's stupid. How are they getting a pay rise when half of government agencies are losing their jobs, people will be struggling to pay bills and there's also a cost-of-living crisis."</p>
        
            <p>Meanwhile, a teacher said: "We've recently got ourselves a pay rise but nowhere near that sort of pay.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm also a bit worried about cuts in the public sector so if money is available perhaps it should go to public services and maintaining employees there."</p>
        
            <p>Others, like a woman who works for charity, were more supportive.</p>
        
            <p>"Well to be fair, if it's the first pay rise in over six years and it's only 2.8 percent then that sounds pretty reasonable. It's a really hard time to be announcing a pay rise isn't it? Wellington feels like a disaster zone at the moment, quite honesty.</p>
        
            <p>"I work for a charity and we're all struggling to wonder where we're going to get some money from. So, not great but hey, six years is a long time."</p>
        
            <p>A man in Wellington said" "It's probably okay, 2.8 percent is below the level of inflation but everybody else should get the same probably.</p>
        
            <p>"I'm in the public service and there's quite a bit of pain being felt through the public service so maybe the right thing for parliamentarians to do is to share a bit of that pain."</p>
        
            <p>Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has indicated he does not want or need the increase in earnings and will be donating his share to charity.</p>
