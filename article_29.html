        <h2>Life at the Olympic Village: Athletes give us a sneak peek</h2>
        <p>
Try a baguette making workshop. Get yourself a Parisian Pony at the hair salon. And what are those cardboard beds really like?

            <p>A baguette making workshop, free arcade games and and reviews of the infamous cardboard beds - young athletes are letting us into life at the Olympic Village.</p>
        
            <p>Canoeist Sofia Reinoso showed what the twin size, 'anti-intimacy' beds are made of, lifting up her mattress to reveal a thin structure of cardboard blocks, before jumping on the bed repeatedly to zero bounce-back.</p>
        
            <p>The beds are said to support the body for a restful sleep and act as a deterrent for anything other than sleeping. The official Olympics TikTok boasted their comfort, saying the beds are made with adjustable firmness and size - but not everyone's found them comfy - one Australian athlete reckons hers was "rock solid".</p>

            <p>Others have been a bit luckier - Australian water polo player Tilly Kearns scored a memory foam mattress topper, thanks to her manager Luke Kearn. She showed her gratitude in a TikTok unrolling the topper: "I was woken up every second hour, I thought I was going to sleep on the floor ... you can expect some gold medal performances from here on out".</p>
        
            <p>Despite the intended purpose of the anti-intimacy beds, Olympic organisers are taking no chances when it comes to athletes' wellbeing: On Tuesday more than 200,000 condoms and other contraceptives arrived at the Olympic Village.</p>
        
            <p>21-year-old gymnast Aleah Finnegan took TikTok viewers on a behind-the-scenes tour of the Village dining hall. She even attended an on-site baguette making workshop.</p>
        
            <p>The dining hall features six food courts with offerings from around the world, including European, Asian and Halal options.</p>
        
            <p>Four Michelin-starred chefs work on-site to prepare protein-heavy French cuisine for the athletes - there's poached eggs, artichoke cream and shavings of sheep's cheese topped with truffle - but you can't have a French menu without plenty of croissants and baguettes too; the dining hall features an extensive bread and pastries section.</p>
        
            <p>The Village is aiming to be healthier this year. In a devastating blow for athletes hoping to celebrate a gold medal the Usain Bolt way - with 1000 chicken nuggets - the iconic McDonald's menu item will not be available. Instead athletes can celebrate with plenty of fruit and dessert like Parisian flan, lemon-meringue tartlets, tiramisu and cheesecake.</p>
        
            <p>For those craving a taste of home, there's an option to import favourites - America has shipped peanut butter, Australia has brought a barista, and Japan has requested miso.</p>
        
            <p>The New Zealand Team TikTok shared more perks of the village: an on-site hair and beauty salon, a mindfulness zone, and an arcade.</p>
        
            <p>The mindfulness and relaxation area comes three years after gymnast Simone Biles put the mental health of athletes centre stage at the Tokyo Olympics. It offers virtual reality headsets for meditation, sleep pods, and art activities, all in a low-lighting environment designed to be soothing and quiet.</p>
        
            <p>Athletes can opt in for complimentary treatments at the Beauty and Grooming Salon, which features styles inspired by the athleticism and triumph of the Games. You could get a Parisian Pony or a Champion Curl, Maybe you want a Sprint Finish (a speedy razor-sharp cut), Boss Beard or Game Face (a clean shave).</p>
        
            <p>At the games centre, athletes can enjoy a range of classic arcade games like Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, air hockey, foosball, and basketball, all free of charge.</p>

            <p>Far from Paris, the world's top surfers showed another side of Olympic life.</p>
        
            <p>Their floating village is in Tahiti aboard a cruise ship; the Aranui 5 comes with ocean views, a sky bar, a dancing room, a library, a fitness room and spa, and, according to surfer Tim Elter, no cardboard beds in sight.</p>
        
            <p>"As you can see, we have big double beds with aluminium frames," Elter says in the video. "We got it better than the guys in Paris."</p>
        
            <p>Day-in-the-life vlogs and outfit checks are a popular piece of TikTok content - and Olympic teams are getting in on the game.</p>
        
            <p>Mongolia stole the show at the Paris Olympics opening ceremony, wearing outfits designed by Michel and Amazonka. They featured national and olympic symbols like the nine white banners, the old torch, and golden embroidery of the sun, moon and guamaral.</p>
        
            <p>On the casual front, Canadian athletes showcased Lululemon athleisure, the Netherlands team sported New Originals warmer sets, and US athletes shared their designer sports jackets made by Ralph Lauren.</p>
