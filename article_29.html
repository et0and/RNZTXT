        <h2>King's Birthday: What's open, what's not, and when you have to pay a surcharge</h2>

King's Birthday will be celebrated on 3 June with a public holiday. Here's what you need to know.

            <p>For more than 70 years, the first Monday of June was known as Queen's Birthday. This year, New Zealand will be celebrating the King's Birthday on Monday 3 June.</p>
        
            <p>Although the day goes by a different name, the rules are much the same. Just like the Queen's Birthday, the public holiday is a non-working day.</p>
        
            <p>That means if you're working on the day (as regularly rostered), you're entitled to time-and-a-half pay and an alternative day off.</p>
        
            <p>Trading restrictions don't apply to King's Birthday in the way they would for Easter holidays, Christmas, or the first half of Anzac Day.</p>
        
            <p>Shops, restaurants, cafes and other hospitality and retail venues will be open as usual, but they can choose to close if they wish - so it pays to check opening hours beforehand.</p>
        
            <p>Supermarkets and malls will be open too, but some may operate with shorter hours.</p>
        
            <p>Public holidays are an expensive day to be a business and King's Birthday is no different.</p>
        
            <p>Hospitality businesses in particular may add a 15 percent surcharge to their services - this is usually to cover the costs of paying employees time-and-a-half.</p>
        
            <p>If a business does charge a surcharge, they must have clear signage communicating this to the customer.</p>
        
            <p>This can be done with the display of signs detailing the surcharge, a message on the business's website, or by verbally letting the customer know at the time of purchase or before they order.</p>
        
            <p>If customers believe they have been misled about a surcharge, they can complain to the Commerce Commission.</p>
        
            <p>Although King Charles III's birthday falls later in the year, New Zealand still marks the monarch's birthday in June.</p>
        
            <p>King Charles will officially celebrate his 76th birthday on 14 November, but now that he has taken the throne, he receives the privilege of celebrating his birthday twice every year.</p>
        
            <p>It was the same with Queen Elizabeth, whose real birthday was on 21 April.</p>
        
            <p>The reason? Britain's winter weather.</p>
        
            <p>It's traditional for British monarchs who are not born in summer to celebrate twice, with a second official birthday. Once on their actual date of birth, and then later in the British summer with a grand parade.</p>
        
            <p>The tradition was started by George II in 1748, who also had a November birthday, and deemed it too cold for a celebratory parade.</p>
