            <p>With the latest cyclone season underway in the South Pacific, RNZ asks NIWA forecasting and media principal scientist Chris Brandolino to explain what a tropical cyclone actually is.</p>
        
            <p>Last week Cyclone Mal hit Fiji - with heavy rainfall, downed powerlines and fallen trees causing widespread disruption.</p>
        
            <p>Brandolino says a tropical cyclone is basically a large storm which begins in the tropics.</p>
        
            <p>They are often sparked by a pulse of energy called the Madden-Julian Oscillation [MJO] which circumnavigates the globe.</p>
        
            <p>"During the summer season or the warm season so late spring to mid Autumn when the MJO passes over warm ocean temperatures - especially if they are unusually warm - often times that can be the spark needed to get a tropical cyclone going."</p>
        
            <p>Brandolino says tropical cyclones are vast heat engines that thrive off warm ocean waters.</p>
        
            <p>"Twenty-six to 27 degrees is kind of the minimum threshold to sustain a tropical cyclone."</p>
        
            <p>The warmer the ocean temperature, the stronger tropical cyclones tend to get, he says.</p>
        
            <p>"For example if a tropical cyclone were to move over ocean temperatures that were 30 or 31 Celsius that would be more fuel for a tropical cyclone than 27 or 28 degree Celsius water."</p>
        
            <p>He says there is no difference between a cyclone and a tropical cyclone besides the very fact a tropical cyclone happens in the tropics.</p>
        
            <p>The time meteorologists generally expect to see cyclones in the Pacific is during the cyclone season, which runs from 1 November to 30 April.</p>
        
            <p>Brandolino says it has been a busy season so far.</p>
        
            <p>"This is the first time we have had two category three tropical cyclones or higher this early in the year going back to I believe 1969, when we [started having] reliable satellite records."</p>
        
            <p>He said NIWA's Tropical Cyclone Outlook predicts there will be nine to 14 tropical cyclones in the South-West Pacific this season.</p>
        
            <p>"If you look at the long term average it is right around nine, so we are calling for a season as a whole that is likely to be average or above average in terms of activity, and we already have two in the books so we're living up to that expectation."</p>
        
            <p>Brandolino says the risk of an ex-tropical cyclone having an impact on New Zealand or to come within about 550 kilometres of our shoreline is considered to be average or below average.</p>
        
            <p>"But, none the less it just takes one, so I think the message is people need to be vigilant, and if you are travelling to the Pacific Islands for a holiday or for work certainly keep an eye on the forecast."</p>
        
            <p>He says areas like the Vanuatu, Fiji, and the Solomon Islands should watch their risk over the coming months.</p>
        
            <p>"Their risk for seeing tropical cyclones is certainly at the very lowest average - if not higher than average."</p>
        
            <p>What category a cyclone comes under depends on the average wind speed of the storm. There are five categories for storms which are listed below.</p>
